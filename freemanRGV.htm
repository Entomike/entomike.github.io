        <hr>
        <p>The Pharr area, which is about the center of the lower Rio Grande
        Valley section, is one of the most interesting places to collect as you
        do not know what you are going to collect from day to day and from one
        year to the next. This part of Texas is definitely sub-tropical and many
        of the species that occur as native species are the same as you will
        find two hundred miles south in Mexico. The number of strays and new
        records for the United States that turn up in and around Pharr is
        remarkable. Because of the condition of the land and other factors the
        best collecting is to be done around the irrigation ditches and canals
        and along the Rio Grande river. One of the best places to collect was
        found to be on the La Reforma ranch which is situated north of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=+Hidalgo,+TX&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=26.197341,-98.048859&amp;spn=0.476868,0.884399&amp;z=10&amp;iwloc=addr">Hidalgo</a>
        just off the McAllen road [South 23rd Street]. Any person desiring to
        find this locality can get there by driving from Hidalgo along beside
        the railroad and turn left on a dirt road that has the high power line
        running parallel with it. This turn-off is just about two miles from
        Hidalgo and you can go forward on this dirt road for about three-fourths
        of a mile and your will drive into the wooded area. Here is the place
        where I turned up a number of new United States records and saw my only
        Morpho in the United States. Butterflies fairly swarm during all the
        months of the year and only a few of the most interesting will be
        mentioned. Here along the sides of the road<br>

        <p>...&nbsp; and many others may be found.</p>
        <p>Another excellent place to collect is six miles north of McAllen on
        the road to Edinburg. It is up and down the irrigation canal that
        crosses under the highway.</p>
        <p>Just west of Mission two species of Megathymidae may be collected, <i>Megathymus
        yuccae wilsonorum</i> Stallings &amp; Turner and <i>Stallingsia
        maculosus</i> (Freeman). To collect in that part of the state, just
        locate a nice irrigation ditch that has been there for several years and
        has had a lot of vegetation around it.</p>
        <p>In the section around Pharr it is doubtful whether a person would
        ever get all of the species that occur around that locality, as each
        year new things make their appearance and ones that were there the year
        before fail to appear.
