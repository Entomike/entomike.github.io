        Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera &nbsp;40: xiv + 658 pp.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This new publication includes an exhaustive synonymic catalogue of
        all names that have been applied to the butterflies of the United States
        of American and Canada, through June, 2006. Eight hundred species and
        234 genera are included from the region, and extensive lists of excluded
        species and excluded names are provided. In addition, a complete
        bibliography to the butterflies of the region is included, together with
        a subspecies-level checklist and taxonomic index. The synonymic
        catalogue enumerates names from family to species, and ancillary details
        are provided for each, including the original description, original
        combination, type locality, deposition of type(s) when known, and
        annotations when pertinent to their placement within the catalogue. Over
        one hundred pages (of 600 estimated total pages) are dedicated to the
        bibliography, which is the most complete ever assembled for the region.</p>
        <p>This document, representing over 20 years of research by the author,
        is being published as Volume 40 of the Journal of Research on the
        Lepidoptera. The contents of this publication have been carefully
        peer-reviewed by leading authorities in the field (as noted in the
        acknowledgments). This is perhaps the most inclusive taxonomic catalogue
        ever published for a regional butterfly fauna, in that the synonymic
        catalogue, supplemental lists, subspecies-level checklist, index, and
        complete bibliography are all included together in the same volume.</p>
        <p>Cost (= annual subscription to the Journal of Research on the
        Lepidoptera): US $25.00 (add US $7 for shipping in the USA;
        international buyers will be billed separately for shipping costs, which
        will vary depending on destination)</p>
