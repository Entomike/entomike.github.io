        <p>Just pull your car up in front of her house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I dare you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just go
        take a look at what the City [of Houston] now says is illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>You need to go even if you don’t like nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Even if you have never looked at a butterfly or a pupae.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>You need to go especially if you think you know something about
        “weeds.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>

        <p>I pulled up alongside <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=704+Arlington+St&amp;csz=houston+tx&amp;country=us&amp;new=1&amp;name=&amp;qty="><font color="#0000FF">her
        front yard</font></a> and stopped my car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I was trying to read the posted signs about “nature
        preserve.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A blue
        energy-efficient car pulled up, stopped, and then drove in the driveway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I thought for a moment I should leave but her “weeds” had
        made it to the <a href="#Front"><font color="#0000FF">front page of the
        Houston Chronicle (June 27, 2005)</font></a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I guessed privacy wasn’t really the main issue at this point.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </p>
        <p>I saw someone in a flowered sleeveless top and khaki shorts bounce
        through the “weeds.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        watched closely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was she
        old, eccentric, wizened, or crotchety? You know—all the things you
        might begin to imagine if the City was going to place a lien on her
        property.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The flowered top appeared to disappear in the “weeds”
        just before it lit right in front of me. She was smiling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>She taught me to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">see</i>
        butterflies right there in front of me that I had missed for looking at
        the “weeds.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        butterflies kept appearing out of nowhere. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>“Wait!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>she said as she ran up to the front porch and came back with a
        jar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Inside the jar was an
        unspectacular caterpillar slowly climbing up a plant. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>“Have
        you ever seen one?” she asked. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Reaching
        out she fingered one leaf about the size of a dime amidst the millions
        of leaves on the “weeds” in her property.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The one she touched had a small hole in it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“See,” she said. “I was hoping they would find this.
        Wait!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>she said again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I was left standing in her front “weeds” trying to see
        caterpillars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Look,”
        she said. “Here’s one pupating.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I looked and saw another glass jar with a plant and water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This brown looking V-shaped thing was hanging down from the top
        of the jar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“There,”
        she said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I peered closer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One-half
        caterpillar and one half pupae it looked, well, weird.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“Isn’t’ that cool?” she said and smiled again.
        “Wait!” she asked. Was she running back and forth or flitting?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>She held a book in her hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“This is what it will look like later,” she said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She pointed out patterns and colors of wings she was
        hoping to see and wings she had already seen this year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>She pointed below the pictures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“See this?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>she
        said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“It tells what each
        butterfly lives on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I go
        out and get the seeds and spread them and then hope.” <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>She
        began pointing out the differences among the “weeds.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>See how similar they are?” she said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“You could easily mistake one for the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Someone from some society came out and told me I needed to cut
        this weed down and this one,” she pointed and laughed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“We each have our own thing,” she smiled. Her smile was
        infectious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was not an
        angry person despite $3000 worth of fines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This was not a crazy person unable to make sense of the world or
        unable to care about the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
        was a woman whose life was made up of knowing pupae, larvae, host
        plants, butterflies and “weeds.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“Isn’t it cool?” she said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“Thanks for coming by,” and she was gone again.<o:p>

          came to my yard for over an hour- &amp; that was SO rewarding to
          see/hear my influence on those kids in their own words !!!!! There was
          a change just while they were experiencing my yard. A Zebra Longwing
          showed up &amp; they all got to see it. Of course I was overwhelmed w/
          excitement so they saw my passion<font SIZE="2">!</font></p>

          window, open back door &amp; another open window in which the window
          unit had been removed. She said I had rats. I told her house had rats
