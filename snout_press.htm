<h3>Area
is being besieged by butterflies</h3>

<p>If it seems the tiny winged creatures meeting a messy demise on your
windshield are a bit more striking than the usual bug carcasses, you're not
alone.</p>
<p>The prolonged drought, interrupted by a few days of heavy rains, has spawned
an explosion of American snout butterflies across Central and South Texas,
experts say.</p>

<h3>The Weather’s
Right For A Butterfly Swarm</h3>
<p>Wildlife experts say the weather's been just right to create an abundance of
butterflies in parts of Central and South Texas.</p>
<p>The swarms of American snout butterflies took flight about a week ago.</p>
<p>They've been spotted across the region in places such as Eagle Pass, Hondo,
San Antonio and Kerr County.</p>

<h3>Residents
concerned with butterflies</h3>

<p><b>Millions of butterflies on the move</b></p>

<p>BROWNSVILLE -- Swarms of butterflies are causing big problems for drivers in
the Valley. The snout butterfly or what's left of the them are on car
windshields throughout the area. Many folks are filling up carwashes to clean up
the mess.</p>

<p>Experts say the snout butterflies are moving around due to the recent rains.
It is estimated millions of the butterflies are on the move in South Texas.</p>

<p>As he stood near the scoreboard area at the Brackenridge Municipal clubhouse
Thursday, Isaac Idstein looked as if he had swallowed one of the American snout
butterflies swarming the area.</p>

<p>The golfer was sick to his stomach.</p>

<h3>All
aflutter</h3>

<p><span class="byline">By Gerard MacCrossan</span></p>

<p><span class="body">Kerrville has been inundated with tiny winged visitors in
recent weeks.<br>
<br>
American snout butterflies are fluttering all around, an unusual phenomenon that
local naturalists attribute to the drought. While a lack of rainfall is
unfavorable for most species, it has created favorable conditions for snouts
this summer.<br>
<br>
Master Naturalist Priscilla Stanley, who volunteers at the Riverside Nature
Center, said the snouts feed on hackberries. The environmental conditions this
year reduced the number of parasites, which gave the snout a greater opportunity
to survive the larva stage.</span></p>

<h3>Butterfly bonanza</h3>

<p>Odessa has a large number of unexpected guests in town. Jeanette Driver, a
Southwest Bank teller, said she sees swarms of butterflies every day outside the
bank. She first noticed a bevy of butterflies outside her house almost a week
ago. She thought they were moths and that it was “weird” that there were so
many of them flying in the daytime. “I thought something was invading us,”
she said. “There were jillions of them in my yard.”</p>

<h3>Butterflies
Swarm Over Area&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>The remarkable swarms of small brown butterflies that have moved in upon
Fredericksburg recently are American Snout butterflies.</b></p>

<p>“Absolutely extraordinary numbers” of the butterflies have been reported
not only in Gillespie County but around the state, from Brownsville to Oklahoma,
according to Mike Quinn, invertebrate biologist with Texas Parks and Wildlife. A
unique combination of natural conditions have led to the butterfly’s “population
explosion,” he said.</p>

<h3>Invasion
of the flitterbys -- snout butterflies arrive from the Brasada&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Burr Williams-MRT Correspondent&nbsp;<br><a href="http://www.mrt.com/">
Midland Reporter-Telegram&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>During the last week of July, a butterfly invasion occurred.</p>

<p>Dozens of people called the Sibley Nature Center to ask a variety of
questions: "Are they a pest? What do they eat? Where did they come from?
Are they moths or butterflies? Just what is the dang deal?"</p>

<p>A similar invasion of the same butterfly, the snout, occurred in 1983.
Exponential population explosions of arthropods are memorable, but irregular.
Some Midlanders may remember the Midland Cubs baseball game interrupted by
migrating grasshoppers in 1973. Others may remember the mesquite twig girdler
invasion of 1996 that left millions of the beetles dead at the doors of brightly
lit business and schools over the span of a few days.</p>

<h3><a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14172350/">Big-nosed butterflies invade
South Texas</a>&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>But even enthusiasts aren't enthused by these ‘Snouts.’ Why?</b></p>

<p>John Larson&nbsp;<br>
Correspondent&nbsp;<br>
NBC Nightly News <br>
</p>
<p>MISSION, Texas - Along the Mexico-Texas border, there is an abundance of
spectacular butterflies.</p>

<p>But this isn't about them. This is about a dull, little brown butterfly which
you'd quickly forget — except for its preposterously huge nose.</p>

<p>"Looks almost like a leaf, the way that snout comes off the head of the
butterfly," says one butterfly enthusiast. [David Dauphin]</p>

<p>And its unreal ability to reproduce.</p>

<p>Due to perfect breeding conditions here, billions — not millions —
billions of brown "American snouts" are migrating across Texas in
historic numbers.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't call the snout spectacular," says another observer.
[Gil Quintanillo]</p>

<p>You'd think butterfly lovers would be ecstatic, but no. The problem is, these
parts have more than 300 exotic, beautifully colored butterflies, and the snouts
are, well, just snouts.</p>

<p>"They're not a calendar butterfly, no," says Professor Lawrence
Gilbert of the University of Texas-Austin about the brown American snout.</p>

<h3>Butterfly
Invasion Thinning; Trees Should Be Fine</h3>

<p>By Molly Keck, Texas Cooperative Extension Program Specialist</p>

<p>It's hard not to notice them. They're everywhere and they're called snout
butterflies. They've also been referred to as hackberry butterflies because they
lay their eggs on hackberry trees. They are swarming - or migrating - right now
because of the weather. They are pretty common in the south and west and also in
San Antonio every year, but during drought conditions like these, they have a
massive bloom and migrate northward.</p>

<p>They aren't like Monarchs, which migrate from a specific place to another
specific place. These guys are just kind of meeting up around the San Antonio
area, mating, and laying their eggs. Back in 1996 we had a massive migration and
the skies literally turned black in the middle of the day south of San Antonio.</p>

<h3>Second
butterfly outbreak surprised experts</h3>

<p>By Gerard MacCrossan&nbsp;</p>

<p>Millions of butterflies swarmed through Kerr County this week signaling a
second 2007 &lt;sic&gt; outbreak of the American Snout.</p>

<p>This week’s arrival follows July’s large snout butterfly outbreak.</p>

<p>“They are on a tear east from San Antonio, out to Kerrville and (covering)
a wide swath down to Uvalde County,” Quinn said. “Some people are reporting
it is greater than the previous numbers.”</p>

swarm the county</a></h3>

<i>By Jessica Hawley-Jerome - Managing Editor</i>
<p><span class="story">A second round of the American Snout Butterfly has
swarmed the Hill Country, leaving plenty of questions and residue behind. Many
experts have speculated why the migratory mini-monarchs are freely flying
through the area once again, but most agree that the wave may indicate a pattern
of regular visitation.</span></p>

<p><span class="story">The American Snout first arrived in Bandera in late July.
Texas Cooperative Extension Agent Warren Thigpen said that the butterflies were
attracted to the county's indigenous hackberry trees, and otherwise posed no
threat to the environment.</span></p>

<p><span class="story">He was unable to pinpoint where the snouts were headed,
but they seemed to be traveling north. They disappeared for about a month before
coming back in droves.</span></p>
