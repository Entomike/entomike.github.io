<p align="left"><a href="#Gilbert">Gilbert's</a>  review of <a href="#Biblio">published
accounts</a> of snout outbreaks in south Texas between 1912 and 1980 found that
they <span style="font-weight: bold;">occur from late June to mid-October</span>.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="#Gilbert">Gilbert</a> was the first to study
snout migrations at their points
of origin. During the summers of 1976, 1977 and 1978, Gilbert and his
graduate students centered their snout investigations on the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Pd8n3JaPhks">Chaparral Wildlife Management Area</a> in the heart of the <a href="https://tpwd.texas.gov/education/hunter-education/online-course/images-conservation/mapstxbrush.png">south Texas brushlands</a>, approximately halfway between San Antonio and Laredo. On the 5,200 acre "Chap," they observed an
extreme range of weather conditions and associated snout migrations.</p>
<p align="left">
In early to mid-July 1976, the Chaparral WMA received 11 inches of rain (about
10.25 inches above normal). On July 26, 1976, <a href="#Gilbert">Gilbert</a>
found an area on the Chap where Spiny Hackberry was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080516072219/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/%7Egilbert/teaching/zoo369/hackberry.html"> totally
defoliated</a> by snout larvae. <span style="font-weight: bold;">On one 3 m diameter hackberry shrub, they counted
2027 snout pupae.</span> The pupae showed a relatively low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid">parasitoid</a>
rate of 8% (n = 658).</p>
<p align="left">The pupae sampled on July 27, 1976 showed a nearly even sex
ratio of 1.15 (79 males to 69 females). On July 28, the butterflies began
emerging from their pupal stage and started to emigrate. The emigrating adults
were sampled to determine their sex ratio. Given that the caterpillar food
plants were <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080516072219/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/%7Egilbert/teaching/zoo369/hackberry.html">defoliated</a>,
the migratory adult sex ratio was expected to be female biased, with the females
departing to search for non-defoliated hackberries. Much to his amazement
(because no one had looked at this before), <a href="#Gilbert">Gilbert</a> found the opposite! On July
28, the migrating adults had a sex ratio of 83.5 (<b>167 males to 2 females</b>).&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Close inspection of the defoliated hackberry revealed that it
was actually still putting on new leaves! The females mated as they emerged and
remained to lay eggs on the new shoots. <span style="font-weight: bold;">On a sample of 50 shoots, they found one
egg on about every other shoot.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">If the females were staying behind to mate and lay eggs, why
were the males departing in mass? <a href="#Gilbert">Gilbert</a> deduced that many of the females at
this site were mating with males from a prior generation and therefore the males
emerging on July 28 were most likely departing to find females that had yet to
mate. While the pupae were nearly evenly split between males and females on July
27, on the same day males were almost 2 to 1 as common as females (n<i><b> </b></i>=
40) on <i><a href="http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/bio406d/images/pics/rhm/condalia_hookeri.htm">Condalia</a></i>
flowers. This excess of males may have been from a prior generation and better
able to compete for the emerging females than were the emerging males.</p>
<p align="left">Migrating snouts were re-sampled on the Chap on August 11, 1976
and the sex ratio had evened out somewhat to 7.0 (76 males to 11 females). The
egg and larval density may have finally reached a high enough level to induce
the females to migrate to areas of lower host competition.</p>
<p align="left">From June 1977 until May 1978, the <a href="http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/hunt/wma/find_a_wma/list/?id=45">Chaparral WMA</a> and the region
generally suffered one of the most severe droughts on record. On May 7, <a href="#Gilbert">Gilbert</a> found
a single snout during six hours on the Chap. Through the rest of May and June,
rainfall was well above average, thus allowing for a rapid increase in snout
populations over 2 - 3 generations. Then in late July <a href="http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/1978/AMELIA/track.gif">Tropical Storm Amelia
tracked</a> up through south Texas. Amelia produced the <b><i> largest three-day total rainfall ever recorded in the United States</i></b> on the Manatt ranch,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_County,_Texas"> Medina
County</a>, where more than 48 inches of rain fell during the period August 1 to 3
(<a href="#Hansen">Hansen</a> 1979, <a href="#Caran">Caran &amp; Baker</a> 1986: <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/balcones_escarpment/images/p4fig2.gif">Fig.
2(7)</a>!</p>
<p align="left">The response of the snout butterflies was spectacular! After approximately 100
days of conditions favorable for hackberry leaf growth, the snouts reached
astronomical numbers. Extracting from <a href="#Ellisor">Ellisor</a> (1970), Gilbert
estimated 1.56 million hackberry shrubs on the <a href="http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/hunt/wma/find_a_wma/list/?id=45">Chaparral WMA</a>, or an average of 255 hackberry shrubs per hectare (= 91
hackberry shrubs per acre). Of these, no
less than 85 % or 1.32 million were defoliated in August 1978. Using data
collected in 1976, Gilbert determined that under optimal conditions, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the average 1.5 m
diameter hackberry shrub could produce no less than 400 snout adults</span>. Thus Gilbert estimated
<span style="font-weight: bold;">the total snout population generated on the Chap in 1978 was approximately one half
billion!</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the American Snout is characterized by late summer migrations, region-wide movements,
and male-biased sex ratio in migratory populations.</span></p></li></ul>It
must be emphasized that the snout's mass directional movements are not
migratory in the traditional sense, that is, north in the spring and
south in the fall. Instead, snouts move locally from patch to patch of
suitable habitat. Typical uneven rainfall across south Texas creates uneven
patchs of suitable hackberry shrubs.
<a href="#Gilbert">Gilbert</a> reported snouts in 1976 moving in three
different directions east of I-35 (see arrows A, B, and C in Fig. 4
below), with one flight actually reversing directions between morning
and afternoon!&nbsp; Gilbert reports that snouts generally fly at speeds
ranging from 5 to 8 mph, hardly the speed necessary for long distance
migrations.<br>

        <p align="left">Under optimal conditions, snouts can go from egg to adult in ~16
days!
    </p></li></ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">So it appears that classic conditions of drought followed by
wide-spread rains occurred prior to the snout outbreaks in 2005.</p>
<p align="left">In the <a href="http://listserv.uh.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=tx-butterfly">archives
of TX-Butterfly</a> is a most interesting <a href="http://listserv.uh.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0410&amp;L=TX-BUTTERFLY&amp;P=R13274&amp;I=-3&amp;X=66543110A8E36DD34A&amp;Y=ento%40austin.rr.com">report</a>
of a snout outbreak observed by John &amp; Gloria Tveten on October 14,
2004 at
the old manager's residence at Santa
Ana NWR, Alamo, TX. They reported "thousands, if not tens of thousands,
of larvae" on the Spiny
Hackberry. In addition, snout pupae were "present in great profusion,
sometimes a dozen or more hanging from a single twig."
Also, adults were in the midst of a "mass emergence." The Tveten's
noted (at least slightly more mature) males mating with females whose
wings had
yet to dry. "Many were coupled mating pairs, and in quite a few of
those pairs, a fully expanded male was mating with a newly emerged
female,
her wings only partially expanded."</p>
<p align="left">Above average rains again preceded the observed outbreak at
Santa Ana NWR. Mid-October is also the latest for any <a href="#Biblio">published</a>
account of snout migrations in south Texas.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p align="left">As for the absolute colossal snout migration mentioned at the
start of this website:</p>
<p align="left">In late September 1921 an estimated <i><b>25 million per minute</b></i>
southeasterly-bound snout butterflies passed over a 250 mile front (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=San+Marcos,+TX&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=29.954935,-97.932129&amp;spn=9.073678,22.148438&amp;om=1">San Marcos</a>
south to the Rio Grande River). <a href="#Gable">Gable and Baker</a> (1922)
noted that this flight lasted 18 days. It may have involved more that 6 billion
(6,000,000,000) butterflies.</p>
<p align="left">The following rain event was surely a contributing factor:</p>
<p align="left">The <b><i> most severe rainstorm ever recorded in the continental United States</i></b> occurred September 9-10, 1921, in
<a href="http://local.google.com/local?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Thrall,+TX&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=30.656816,-97.294922&amp;spn=9.00919,22.148438&amp;om=1">Thrall</a>,
approximately 40 miles NE of Austin. (<a href="#Jennings">Jennings</a>, 1950; <a href="#Bomar">Bomar</a>,

2</a>). A total of <b><i> 36.4 inches of rain fell in 18 hr</i></b>, which is the
<b><i> world's record for this period</i></b>. The 24-hr total exceed in one day the expected precipitation of an entire year
(<a href="#Larkin">Larkin and Bomar</a>, 1983, <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/balcones_escarpment/images/p6fig4.gif"> pg.
18</a>). This storm, which spread over a large area of Central Texas, produced 215 deaths and 19 million dollars in property damage
(<a href="#Bomar">Bomar</a>,

<h2 align="center">Snout Migrations Outside of Texas</h2>
<p align="left">Snout migrations are not strictly limited to the south Texas brushlands. <a href="#Howe">Howe</a>
(1975) writes that "On August 9, 1966, [snout] migrants were so numerous
that they obscured the sun over Tucson, Arizona, and it was necessary to turn on
the street lights!" and "In September and early October, 1971,
hundreds of <span style="font-style: italic;">carinenta </span>invaded Franklin
County, Kansas. They were taken visiting wild asters with three and four
individuals taken in a single net swing. Individuals could be observed flying in
a due north-northeast direction from the south." <a href="#Neck">Neck</a>
(1983) suggests that these Kansan snouts probably originated in Texas.</p>
<p><a href="#Gochfeld">Gochfeld &amp; Burger</a> (1997) report that in New Jersey snouts are
usually rare to uncommon and local as an immigrant; most records are of single
individuals, but occasionally abundant as in 1994. Up to forty per day in
hackberry grove near Rutgers University stadium. Maximum Fourth of July
Butterfly Count total was 49 at Cape May, NJ in 1994.</p>
<p><a href="#Wormington">Wormington</a> (2006) reports that snouts are an annual
immigrant to <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/on/pelee/index_e.asp">Point
Pelee National Park</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uh3NZKRCVLx">Leamington,
Ontario, Canada</a>, where they often become numerous because of the abundance
of Common Hackberry (<i>Celtis occidentalis</i>). "Normal" period of
occurrence is the middle of June to early October. Extreme dates of occurrence
are May 13 (2000) to November 16 (2001) inclusive. The highest recorded snout
total (800) on a Butterfly Count occurred on July 28, 1984.</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><h2 style="text-align: center;"> Taxonomy</h2><h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>Libytheana carinenta </i><font face="Times New Roman">(Cramer, 1777)</font></h3><p style="text-align: center;">Most authors (<a href="http://listserv.uh.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0309&amp;L=TX-BUTTERFLY&amp;P=R7805&amp;I=-3">see
