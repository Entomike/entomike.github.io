"
For the last 5 years or so I have been referring to a premigration
migration, a migration of apparently reproductive monarchs that moves
south beginning in late July and continuing, in Kansas at least, until
mid August.
I have posted a number of observations of monarchs seen moving south
during
this period to <a href="http://www.MonarchWatch.org/dplex">Dplex-L</a>. A few

others have posted similar observations and we

sometimes get calls from people wondering why the monarchs are migrating so

early. Monarchs generally disappear or only maintain low population densities in most areas south of <a href="https://d2ebzu6go672f3.cloudfront.net/legacy/1012.jpg">37 degrees</a> North from mid May to August.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">However, the region south of <a href="https://d2ebzu6go672f3.cloudfront.net/legacy/1012.jpg">37 degrees</a> is frequently repopulated with

monarchs in August and September (<a href="fall_peak.htm">before the true migration</a>) arrives in a

pattern consistent with the idea that recolonization occurs via butterflies

from the north rather than from a resurgence of the local population.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">If
this is the case, how can we explain the behavior of monarchs moving
south
before the true migration which generally occurs a month later? Why do
these monarchs leave and what environmental cues are they sensitive to
that
trigger this migratory behavior? And, if some leave the north at this
time,
why don't they all do it?<br>

<br>

Given the way we think natural selection acts in these cases, it is standard

to ask why it might be selectively advantageous for some monarchs to move

south ahead of the true migration. One possibility is that there is a

portion of the population that emerges in late July and early August too

late to successfully reproduce at their respective latitudes. For example,

let's suppose that a monarch emerges in Minneapolis on the 1st of August. This butterfly requires 45 <a href="http://monarchwatch.org/blog/2008/01/monarch-degree-days/">degree days</a> before it is sexually mature. This could mean

that it would take 4-5 days before this butterfly would mate. If this

monarch were a female and she started laying eggs on the 6th of August,

continuing to lay eggs for the next three weeks, her first offspring would

mature in 30-35 days (6-11 Sept) about halfway through the fall migration at

this latitude. The mid and late offspring from this female would emerge at

the end of the migration or later and would be subject to killing frosts

that can start in mid to late September in Minneapolis.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">An alternative for

this butterfly is to head south shortly after emergence. This might be more

advantageous than producing offspring that might be too late for the

migration. However, moving south in late July and early August does not

guarantee success. It is often hot and dry during this period and the

milkweeds are usually in poor condition having flowered and beginning to

senesce (grow old). On the other hand, late summer rains south of <a href="https://d2ebzu6go672f3.cloudfront.net/legacy/1012.jpg">37 degrees</a>

N can rejuvenate milkweeds such as <span style="font-style: italic;">A. viridis, A. asperula, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> A.

oenotheroides</span>, providing sources of food for monarch larvae.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Thus, although

a southward migration prior to the real migration might not be successful,

the probability of success could be high enough to be favored by selection.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">If
so, this still leaves the question as to the environmental information
that the butterflies might use as a cue to initiate the migration. At
this
time we don't know what information the butterflies use but the
celestial
information, in terms of sun angle, during this period is similar to
that during the period when the first generation monarchs are moving
north in
May.<br>

<br>
If the scenario I've outlined above is true, the size of the
premigration migration is likely to be a function of the number of
butterflies emerging
in this critical period and this in turn is related to the time of
arrival
of monarchs in the early summer and the overall size of the population.
It
also follows that the reproductive success of the butterflies moving
south is dependent on the condition of the milkweeds and the
availability of
nectar sources to sustain the adults and both of these are dependent on
soil
moisture and rainfall. It could be that there are years when the
premigration migrants produce enough progeny to contribute
significantly to
the overwintering population.<br>

what you

see monarchs doing in your area during the period from the 15th of July to

15 August."
