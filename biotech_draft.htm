Tag recoveries made history in the winter of 1998-99. To date, 399 tags applied
by Monarch Watch volunteers in the fall of 1998 have been recovered in Mexico! I
can hardly believe it, but it's true. Tagged Monarchs have been found in areas
adjacent to the overwintering sites in Mexico since 1958. However, it wasn't
until 1975 that the first one was found within an overwintering area - when the
first two of these sites were located by Ken and Cathy Brugger (PAGE 24). (Only
147 tagged Monarchs had been recovered in Mexico from the fall of 1957 through
the winter of 1998.)&nbsp;</p>

In 1999, Monarch Watch recovered its highest number of tags in Mexico: 689. Last
year, Monarch Watch recovered 229 tags in Mexico. By March 1st, I had already
helped Monarch Watch purchase 1,232 tags. Yet there were still more tags out
there. At 50 pesos or about $5.60 per tag, I</p>

<br>
Dr. Doug Buhler, research agronomist at the USDA-ARS, and Dr. Robert Hartzler, associate professor and Extension weed scientist in the Agronomy Department at Iowa State University, found that Iowa roadsides had 48 common milkweed patches per hectare, while corn and soybean fields had only seven patches per hectare. They concluded that common milkweed in roadsides may be especially important to monarchs due to the frequent occurrence of milkweed in roadsides and the uniform distribution of roadsides across the landscape. In another survey, Hartzler and Buhler also found that the majority of milkweeds along roadsides were distant from field edges. Milkweed density was approximately twice as high adjacent to the road (186 patches per hectare) and in the center of the roadside (165 patches per hectare) as it was next to the field edge (89 patches per hectare).<br>

Paper presented at the Monarch Butterfly Research Symposium</p>

<hr width="50%">
<p>Entomologists, nature lovers and the agricultural biotech industry have recently focused their attention on the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), one of the most recognized butterflies in North America.<br>
<br>
Heightened interest followed a highly publicized study in the May 20, 1999, issue of Nature that reported on the possible effects of Bt corn pollen on monarch butterfly larvae. In laboratory feeding experiments, Cornell University researchers found that monarch butterfly larvae fed milkweed leaves artificially coated with pollen from Bt corn ate less, grew slower and suffered a higher death rate than larvae that consumed milkweed leaves free of corn pollen.<br>
<br>
By design, the researchers did not mimic natural conditions. In the laboratory, the caterpillars were given no choice but to feed on leaves artificially covered with corn pollen. The Cornell study raises interesting questions, but further research is needed to determine what impact, if any, Bt corn pollen has on monarchs in their natural, free environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Distribution of Common Milkweed in Iowa by Dawn Refsell</p>
<p>December 14, 2001 - The North Central Weed Science Society held its annual
conference recently in Milwaukee, WI. The primary focus of this meeting is
presentation of weed science research results, either in the form of oral
presentations or posters. The <b>following is an adaptation of a poster</b>
displayed at the meeting. Although this website reaches a much broader audience
than attends the conference, we hope the information is presented in a manner
that can be understood by persons without formal training in weed science.</p>

<hr width="50%">
<p align="left">A survey in 2000 in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota concluded that
the majority of monarch butterflies are produced on milkweeds growing within
agricultural fields (Oberhauser et al. 2001; see also Taylor and Shields, 2000),
with fields in the corn belt particularly important (Wassenaar and Hobson, 1998;
Hobson et al., 1999; Jesse and Obrycki, 2003). Much of the mid-western breeding
habitat is being lost because of changes in U.S. agricultural practices.
Adoption of soybean, and to a lesser extent corn, that has been genetically
engineered to be resistant to herbicides has been widespread. Herbicides are
sprayed in early spring, killing virtually all other emerging plants including
A. syriaca and myriad potential nectar resources. This was forewarned by Brower
(1995, 1999b, 2001) and Taylor (1999, 2004). The scale of this emerging problem
is enormous, but as yet unquantified.</p>

2004 Growing Season Weather Conditions Resulting in Record High Crop Yields in
Illinois and the Midwest</a>. Illinois State Water Survey, Champaign, IL. 24 pp.</p>
<p ALIGN="center"><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Weather
during the 2004 growing season in the Midwest ... produced exceptionally high
yields of all major crops</b> with resulting record yields 10 to 25 percent
above prior records, an exceptional increase. Record corn and soybean yields in
Illinois and five other states had profound effects on crop prices, etc. Crop
experts, regional farmers, and crop-weather models failed to detect and predict
the enormous magnitude of the final yields. This inability to assess the
magnitude of the 2004 crop yields likely resulted from a lack of information
about the presence and effect of the frequent days with clear skies in 2004. <b>The
number of clear days, 50 percent to 105 percent above average across the entire
Midwest, also were accompanied by much below average temperatures and normal
rainfall.</b> Examination of Illinois climate conditions over the past 117 years
reveals that when many clear days occurred, most summers were quite hot and dry.
Only one prior summer (1927) had comparable conditions to those in 2004. Summer
2004 weather conditions also were unusual in other respects, including having
characteristics that were beneficial for all crops. For example, prior record
high yields occurred in 2003 for corn, in 1994 for soybeans, in 2001 for
sorghum, and in 1990 for alfalfa. Seldom does the entire Midwest experience near
uniform summer weather conditions, reflecting another climatologically-unique
aspect of summer 2004 weather. <b>Canadian high-pressure centers, resulting from
the intrusion of 20 strong cold fronts, frequently dominated the atmospheric
circulation across the central United States during the summer</b>, limiting the
movement of warm, moist air into the region and creating the season’s high
frequency of clear days.</p>
