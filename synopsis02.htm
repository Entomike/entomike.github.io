<p>On March 18th of 2002 the Texas Monarch Watch reported that many millions of

monarchs had succumbed to extreme cold weather in Mexico last January. The

mortality was catastrophic. Piles of dead butterflies inches deep littered the

oyamel forest of eastern Michoacan and western parts of the state of Mexico. The

stench was pungent and disheartening. Nonetheless many millions survived. On

March 18th those survivors were just beginning to reach Texas. The spring

migration in Texas has always been hard to gauge, but in 2002 there were no

reports in Texas to suggest that it was smaller than usual.</p>

<p>The fall migration got off to a very bad start. Hardly anything was seen

before 1 October when 500 were spotted in a pecan grove near Midland. Usually

Abilene, its surrounding areas and Wichita Falls report monarchs by the forth

week of September. Substantial numbers were finally observed in Abilene and

Clyde Texas on 6-7 October, nearly two weeks later than usual. By 8 October,

monarchs were being seen at many locations in the central flyway at the latitude

of Interstate 20. By 14 October they had penetrated south to Highway 90, and

were especially abundant in the Nueces River bottom. In a full days observing on

15 October near Hunt, Texas, a hawk watcher, apparently not seeing so many

hawks, counted nearly 1700 monarchs. By taking into account his circumscribed

viewing area, he reasoned that nearly 40,000 monarchs passed through the general

area that day. By 16 October they had reached the Eagle Pass and Del Rio areas.

On the 24th an observer in the Rio Grande Valley saw a very large number in

migration. In spite of occasional mentions of large numbers, the general

consensus was that the migration along the central corridor (Wichita Falls to

Eagle Pass) was much diminished in comparison to years past.</p>

<p>By the end of October thousands were being sighted in Monterrey Mexico and

the coastal migration was beginning to heat up, also somewhat later than usual.

During the first week of November, thousands were seen at Texas City, Baytown,

Matagorda Beach, the head of Lavaca Bay and at Smith Point. The general

consensus for the coastal migration was the opposite of that for the central

flyway. It was believed that the coastal migration was one of the largest ever,

although strangely, very few were reported from the Corpus area and points

immediately to the west. </p>

<p>Until better counting techniques are devised, the best assessment of overall

monarch population size is still the total area occupied by the butterflies in

Mexico during the middle of the wintering season when the clusters are the most

compacted. The Mexican Reserva de la Biosfera Mariposa Monarca has monitored and

mapped the butterfly colonies for the past several years. They continued to do

this this year and were joined by a group of students from the University of

Mexico (UNAM) and by a team of researchers from the US headed by William

Calvert. In a combined effort, all of the colonies were mapped and the area

summed. This year's total is in the middle of the range of butterfly colony

areas recorded over the last 20 years. So the monarchs have at least in part

recovered from the devastating cold storm that killed so many millions last a

year ago this January.</p>
