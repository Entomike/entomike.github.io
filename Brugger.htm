  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Kenneth
  C. Brugger, a self-effacing amateur naturalist who made an unforgettable
  discovery, died on Nov. 25 at his home in </span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Austin,
  Tex. He was 80.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">If
  the Purepecha Indians of central Mexico had been a shade less sophisticated,
  they might have regarded him as a god, and not because the man from Kenosha,
  Wis., who appeared in their remote mountaintop villages in 1975 was a
  brilliant textile engineer whose proudest achievement was his work in
  perfecting the unshrinkable undershirt.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">It
  was because he solved an ancient mystery.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Mr.
  Brugger had long been lionized by lepidopterists in the </span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">United
  States and Canada as the discoverer of the wooded mountain slopes in Mexico
  where hundreds of millions of North American monarch butterflies spend the
  winter.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">But
  to the Indians, who already knew that, Mr. Brugger was the man who brought the
  news of where their beloved monarchs fly off to in the spring: virtually the
  entire eastern </span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">United
  States and the eastern regions of southern Canada.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">From
  either perspective, Mr. Brugger's was a transforming discovery, one that
  settled an issue that had been puzzling scientists for generations, that
  touched off a stampede of butterfly lovers and that transformed the Indian
  culture. Their mountain homeland, 80 miles southwest of </span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Mexico
  City, was turned into a tourist attraction. And this created a campaign to
  protect the monarchs' sanctuaries from loggers and other modern encroachments.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">For
  Mr. Brugger, a modest man who talked little about his achievements, the
  discovery of the monarch butterfly's winter home was a satisfying twist to a
  life of intellectual adventure.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">A
  man whose mechanical aptitude and mathematical brilliance surfaced early in
  his life, Mr. Brugger, who never obtained a college degree, worked as a
  mechanic in his father's garage until World War II. Then the Army saw his test
  scores and assigned him to the Signal Corps at </span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Fort
  Monmouth, N.J., where he worked in cryptology and developed a lifelong
  interest in homing pigeons; at his death he had 13 birds.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Returning
  to </span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Kenosha
  after the war, Mr. Brugger went to work as a junior supervisor for Jockey
  International. By the time a divorce led him to pull up stakes in 1965 and
  start a new life as a textile consultant in Mexico City, he had risen to chief
  engineer for Jockey's worldwide knitting operations, designing, installing and
  tinkering with innovative textile machines. Among them was the compactor,
  which compresses cotton fibers so much that when they spring back in the wash
  it compensates for the inevitable shrinkage.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Mr.
  Brugger's achievements may have been limited to underwear if he had not picked
  up a Mexican newspaper one day in 1973 and seen an advertisement placed by
  Fred A. Urquhart, a University of Toronto scientist who was seeking volunteers
  to help him track the annual migration of monarchs.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Since
  1940, when he began the project, Dr. Urquhart had enlisted 3,000 volunteers
  who had systematically tagged thousands of butterflies, faithfully reported
  sightings of their annual flights south, and learned much about the world's
  only insect migration -- one that is especially remarkable since the monarchs
  that swarm out of Mexico in the spring are not the ones who return in the
  fall.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Because
  of a sustained and unparalleled sexual frenzy, monarchs mate themselves into
  oblivion in a matter of weeks, and it is generally their great-grandchildren
  or great-great-grandchildren, hatched out on milkweed leaves from Texas to
  Canada, that make the return trip for what turns out to be a lazy, celibate
  winter, an abstinence that allows them to live long enough to begin the flight
  back north the next spring.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">The
  one thing Dr. Urquhart had not learned is exactly where the monarchs spend the
  winter.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Recalling
  that he had once driven through a sudden storm of monarch butterflies during a
  trip through the volcanic mountains west of </span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Mexico
  City, Mr. Brugger wrote to Dr. Urquhart and was persuaded to return to the
  area to search for them.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">And
  that is how it happened that on Jan. 2, 1975, a date that lepidopterists hold
  dear, Mr. Brugger and his wife, Catalina, made their way through a forest of
  Oyamel firs until they reached the 10,000-foot level and suddenly realized
  that the trees were covered with monarchs, as many as four million an acre,
  according to later estimates.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">As
  thousands of ecstatic tourists have since discovered, the massed orange and
  black monarchs make a breathtakingly beautiful sight.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">It
  was a beauty that was largely lost on Mr. Brugger, who is survived by three
  children, Carl, of </span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Racine,
  Wis., Katharine Carroll of Kenosha, and Kenneth Jr., of Austin; a brother,
  Robert, of Kenosha; three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">A
  man who once came home with a new sports jacket with an orange stripe he
  thought was green, Mr. Brugger was totally colorblind -- he saw the monarchs
  as shades of gray.</span></font></p>
