      <p align="center"><b>New Skipper Records for the United States<br>
      </b>By H. A. Freeman, Pharr, Texas</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three years of collecting in the Rio
      Grande Valley of Texas the writer has come to the conclusion that many of the
      species of butterflies that occur in the vicinity of Victoria, Tamps,
      Mexico, will eventually be found to stray up around Pharr, Texas. Many of
      these species have been found to be native to this area, while others
      occur here only as stragglers. During 1944-45 the beautiful species, <i>Astraptes
      fulgerator</i> Walsh, was found to be very common and it was not unusual
      for the author to go out and collect as many as thirty or forty specimens
      in one afternoon. During the past year the writer has been unable to get
      more than two specimens. The past twelve months have been very dry here
      and this may account partially for the scarcity of that species. During
      1946 over a hundred specimens of <i>Lerodea tyrtaeus</i> Ploetz were
      collected, thus establishing the fact that this species is very definitely
      native to this part of the state, Some of the other species of skippers
      that have been recorded from down here have failed to show up since the
      single specimen of each was caught. Examples of such stragglers are <i>Astraptes
      hopfferi</i> (Ploetz), <i>Astraptes anaphus</i> (Cramer), <i>Pellicia
      bromias</i> G. &amp; S., and <i>Celaenorrhinus fritzgaertneri</i>
      (Bailey). Two of these species are very powerful flyers and could have
      very easily flown up from Mexico, namely <i>hopfferi</i> (Ploetz) and <i>anaphus</i>
      (Cramer), whereas, although the other two are swift of wing, it is more
      likely that they emerged from their chrysalides somewhere in the area as
      the specimens were very fresh when collected. Possibly, later studies of this
      part of Texas will result in the finding of more specimens of all four
      species.</p>
      <p><b>Aguna asander</b> form <b>panthius</b> (H.-S.)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the examination of some insects collected
      by members of the writer's class in entomology at the Pharr-San Juan-Alamo
      High School, a fresh male specimen of this form was found. It was
      collected by Richard T. Hall and Belva Jean Norman, October 21, 1946, at
      Pharr, Texas. This is the first record of this form having been collected
      in the United States.</p>
      <p><b>Pellicia costimacula</b> H.-S.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The writer caught a fresh male specimen of
      this species ten miles south of Pharr, Texas, November 28, 1946. This is
      the first record of this species having been caught in the United States.</p>
      <p><b>Gorgythion begga pyralina</b> (Moschler)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While collecting with Dr. C. D. Michener, of
      the American Museum of Natural History, twelve miles south of Pharr,
      Texas, the writer caught a female specimen of <i>pyralina</i>, on March
      31, 1946. This is the first recorded evidence of the genus <i>Gorgythion</i>
      occurring in the United States.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sum up the seventeen new skippers recorded
      for the United States published by the writer, the following two divisions
      are made:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Species that are native to the Rio Grande
      Valley of Texas:</p>
