<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">ACTION: Final rule.<br>

<br>

----------------------------------------------------------------------- </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife

Service (Service), determine nine cave-dwelling invertebrates from Bexar County,

Texas, to be endangered species under the authority of the Endangered Species

Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Rhadine exilis (no common name) and <i>Rhadine

infernalis</i> (no common name) are small, essentially eyeless ground beetles. <i>Batrisodes

venyivi</i> (Helotes mold beetle) is a small, eyeless beetle. <i>Texella

cokendolpheri</i> (Robber Baron Cave harvestman) is a small, eyeless harvestman

(daddy-longlegs). <i>Cicurina baronia</i> (Robber Baron cave spider), <i>Cicurina

madla</i> (Madla's cave spider), <i>Cicurina venii</i> (no common name), <i>Cicurina

vespera</i> (vesper cave spider), and <i>Neoleptoneta microps</i> (Government

Canyon cave spider) are all small, eyeless or essentially eyeless spiders. </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These species (referred

to in this final rule as the nine invertebrates) are known from karst topography

(limestone formations containing caves, sinks, fractures and fissures) in north

and northwest Bexar County. Threats to the species and their habitat include

destruction and/or deterioration of habitat by construction; filling of caves

and karst features and loss of permeable cover; contamination from septic

effluent, sewer leaks, run-off, pesticides, and other sources; predation by and

competition with nonnative fire ants; and vandalism. This action will implement

Federal protection provided by the Act for these species. We based our decision

on the best available information, including that received during public comment

on the proposal to list these species. </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of this

rule is December 26, 2000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule

is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the

Austin Ecological Services Field Office, 10711 Burnet Road, Suite 200, Austin,

Texas 78758.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">Background </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Rhadine exilis </i>and<i>

Rhadine infernalis</i> were first collected in 1959 and described by Barr and

Lawrence (1960) as <i>Agonum exile</i> and <i>Agonum infernale</i>,

respectively. Barr (1974) assigned the species to the genus <i>Rhadine</i>. <i>Batrisodes

venyivi</i> was first collected in 1984 and described by Chandler (1992). <i>Texella

cokendolpheri</i> was first collected in 1982 and described in Ubick and Briggs

(1992). <i>Cicurina baronia, Cicurina madla, Cicurina venii, </i>and<i> Cicurina

vespera</i> were first collected in 1969, 1963, 1980, and 1965, respectively. In

1992, Gertsch described these species. <i>Neoleptoneta microps</i> was first

collected in 1965 and described by Gertsch (1974) as <i>Leptoneta microps</i>.

The species was reassigned to <i>Neoleptoneta</i> following Brignoli (1977) and

Platnick (1986). </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> These nine invertebrates are

obligate (capable of surviving in only one environment) karst or cave-dwelling

species (troglobites) of local distribution in karst terrain in Bexar County,

Texas. ``Karst'' is a type of terrain in which the rock is dissolved by water so

that much of the drainage occurs into the subsurface rather than as runoff. The

subsurface drainage leads to passages or other openings within the underground

rock formations. Some of the features that develop in karst areas include cave

openings, holes in rocks, cracks, fissures, and sinkholes. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> Habitat required by the nine

karst invertebrate species consists of underground, honeycomb limestone that

maintains high humidity and stable temperatures. The surface environment of

karst areas is also an integral part of the habitat needed by the animals

inhabiting the underground areas. Openings to the surface allow energy and

nutrients, in the form of leaf litter, surface insects, other animals, and

animal droppings to enter the underground ecosystem. Mammal feces provide a

medium for the growth of fungi and, subsequently, localized population blooms of

several species of tiny, hopping insects. These insects reproduce rapidly on

rich food sources and may become prey for some predatory cave invertebrates

(Service 1994). While the life habits of the nine invertebrates are not well

known, the species probably prey on the eggs, larvae, or adults of other cave

invertebrates. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> We funded a status survey

(Veni 1994a; Reddell 1993) of all nine species through a grant to the Texas

Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) under section 6 of the Act. Researchers

obtained landowner permission to study and assess threats to 41 caves in north

and northwest Bexar County, Texas. Landowners denied permission to access an

additional 36 caves that biologists believed likely to contain species of

concern. Researchers described all 77 caves, to some extent, before the status

survey was conducted and some were already known to contain at least one of the

nine invertebrates. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> During the status survey, the

researchers made a collection of the invertebrate fauna at each cave studied,

assessed the condition of the cave environment and threats to the species, and

collected geological data. They used this information to prepare two reports.

One report discusses the overall karst geography in the San Antonio region and

the potential geologic and geographic barriers to karst invertebrate migration

(on an evolutionary time scale) and limits to their distribution (Veni 1994a).

The other report (Reddell 1993) details the fauna of each cave visited during

the study and presents information obtained from invertebrate collections. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> Veni's (1994a) report

delineates six karst areas (hereafter referred to as karst regions) within Bexar

County. The karst regions he discusses are Stone Oak, UTSA (University of Texas

at San Antonio), Helotes, Government Canyon, Culebra Anticline, and Alamo

Heights. The boundaries of these karst regions are geological or geographical

features that may represent obstructions to troglobite movement (on a geologic

time scale) which has resulted in the present-day distribution of endemic

(restricted in distribution) karst invertebrates in the San Antonio region. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> The harvestman <a name="Texella cokendolpheri"><i>Texella

cokendolpheri</i></a>, Robber Baron Cave harvestman, is known only from Robber

Baron cave in the Alamo Heights karst region on private property. The cave

entrance has been donated to the <a href="http://www.cavetexas.org/tcma/home.htm">Texas

Cave Management Association</a> (George Veni, Veni &amp; Associates, pers. comm.

1995), which will likely be interested in protection and improvement of the cave

habitat. However, this cave is relatively large, and the land over and around

the cave is heavily urbanized. The cave has also been subject to extensive

commercial and recreational use (Veni 1988). No confirmed specimens of <i>T.

cokendolpheri</i> were collected during the 1993 status survey, but one <i>Texella</i>

harvestman collected at Robber Baron Cave since completion of the status survey,

the species of which could not be positively identified, is highly likely to be <i>T.

cokendolpheri</i> (James Reddell, Texas Memorial Museum, and Dr. Darrell Ubick,

California Academy of Sciences, pers. comm. 1995). </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> <a name="Batrisodes venyivi"><i>Batrisodes

venyivi</i></a>, the Helotes mold beetle, is known from only three caves in the

vicinity of Helotes, Texas, northwest of San Antonio. Two of these caves are

located in the Helotes karst region on private property. We do not have reliable

information on the collection from the third cave. The collector of the specimen

declined to give us a specific site collection record, but we believe it is

located on private property. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> <a name="Rhadine exilis"><i>Rhadine

exilis</i></a> is known from 35 caves in north and northwest Bexar County.

Twenty-one are located on Department of Defense (DOD) land in the Stone Oak

karst region. The remainder are distributed among the Helotes, UTSA, and Stone

Oak karst regions, while one location lies in the Government Canyon region. One

of the non-DOD sites is located in a county road right-of-way, one is located in

a state-owned natural area, and the remainder are located on private property.

Ongoing efforts by the DOD to locate and inventory karst features on Camp Bullis

and to document the karst fauna communities in caves on Camp Bullis resulted in

discovery of 18 of the 35 caves mentioned above (Veni 1994b; James Reddell,

pers. comm. 1997).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> <a name="Rhadine infernalis"><i>Rhadine

infernalis</i></a> is known from 25 caves. This species occurs in five of the

six karst regions-- Helotes, UTSA, Stone Oak, Culebra Anticline, and Government

Canyon. Scientists have delineated three subspecies (<i>Rhadine infernalis

ewersi</i>, <i>Rhadine infernalis infernalis, Rhadine infernalis</i> ssp.), and

described and named two of these in scientific literature (Barr 1960, Barr and

Lawrence 1960). In a recent report, scientists characterized the third

subspecies as distinct, but not named (Reddell 1998). Only three caves, all on

DOD land, contain the subspecies <i>Rhadine infernalis ewersi</i>. Sixteen caves

contain the subspecies <i>Rhadine infernalis infernalis</i> and lie in the

Government Canyon, Helotes, UTSA, and Stone Oak regions. Six caves in the

Culebra Anticline region contain the unnamed subspecies. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> <a name="Cicurina venii"><i>Cicurina

venii</i></a> is known from only one cave, which is located on private property

in the Culebra Anticline karst region. The species was collected in 1980 and

1983, but the cave itself was not initially described until 1988 (Reddell 1993).

The cave entrance was filled during construction of a home in 1990. Without

excavation, it is difficult to determine what effect this incident had on the

species; however, there may still be some nutrient input, from a reported small

side passage. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> <a name="Cicurina baronia"><i>Cicurina

baronia</i></a>, the Robber Baron cave spider, is known only from Robber Baron

Cave in the Alamo Heights karst region. Although the cave entrance is owned and

operated by the <a href="http://www.cavetexas.org/tcma/home.htm">Texas Cave

Management Association</a>, it is located in a heavily urbanized area. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> <a name="Cicurina madla"><i>Cicurina

madla</i></a>, Madla's cave spider, is known from six caves. One cave is within

the Government Canyon karst region in <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/govcan/govcan.htm">Government

Canyon State Natural Area</a>, one is on DOD land, three are located in the

Helotes karst region on private property, and one is located on private property

in the UTSA karst region. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> Biologists have found <a name="Cicurina vespera"><i>Cicurina

vespera</i></a>, the vesper cave spider, in two caves. One cave is Government

Canyon Bat Cave in the <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/govcan/govcan.htm">Government

Canyon State Natural Area</a>, and the other is a cave 5 miles northeast of

Helotes. The location and name of this latter cave have not been revealed to us,

but we believe it is located on private property. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> <a name="Neoleptoneta microps"><i>Neoleptoneta

microps</i></a> is known only from the Government Canyon karst region, from two

caves within <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/govcan/govcan.htm">Government

Canyon State Natural Area</a>. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2"> In the course of conducting

the 1993 status survey, Veni contacted landowners and requested access to as

many caves as possible that were believed to be potential habitat for the nine

invertebrates. It is possible that these species occur in some of the caves that

could not be visited and that new locations of the nine invertebrates will be

discovered in the future. Although these new discoveries may increase the number

of locations where the species are found, they are expected to fall within the

same general range and are expected to face the same threats as the known

occurrences of these species. The listing of these species is not based on a

demonstrable decline in the number of individuals or the number of known

locations of each species, but rather on reliable evidence that each species is

subject to threats to its continued existence throughout all or a significant

portion of its range.</font></p>
