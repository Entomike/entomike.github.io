<p>DALLAS – Got ladybugs in the house?</p>
<p>For unknown reasons, ladybug numbers have been large in the last few years.
This time of year, as temperatures cool, the beetles seek warm, dry, protected
areas to hibernate. In the wild, they migrate to crevices in rocks and caves.
But in populated areas, they find house eaves and attics made to order. When
ladybugs gather in large numbers -- sometimes in clumps of thousands – some
eventually will find their way into the living area of the house.
<p>The ladybugs that prefer to hibernate in houses are most likely an Asian
import, Knutson said. Native species of ladybug prefer to hibernate outside, in
garden mulch or under leaf piles, for examples.</p>

<br>
        GREENSBORO, N.C., <b> Oct. 27, 2004</b> -- Infestations of cattle fever ticks along the
U.S.-Mexico border in Texas were sharply higher this year.<br>
<br>
	This information was presented to the USAHA Committee on Parasitic Diseases at
its meeting here this week.  Historically, there are annual incursions of cattle fever
ticks (<i>Boophilus annulatus </i> and<i> B. microplus</i>) into south Texas when errant tick-infested
livestock and free-ranging white-tailed deer from Mexico cross the Rio Grande River.
Each year a variable number of such incursions result in populations of cattle fever
ticks that infest cattle in Texas pastures that are usually near the river.<br>
<br>
	During the first 9 months of 2004, 77 premises were quarantined after cattle
fever tick-infested cattle were identified on them by personnel from the Cattle Fever Tick
Eradication Program of the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).  The
number of infestations discovered this year is almost three times the number found during
the same period in 2003 and is seven times greater than the total number for all of 2002.<br>
<br>
	It is noteworthy that 27 percent of this year’s outbreaks were located in the "Tick
Free Area" outside the Quarantined Zone.  Also, 65 percent of the infested premises have
been in Zapata County, which is located in the lower one third of the nearly 800-kilometer-long
Quarantined Zone and which is separated from Mexico along most of its border by Falcon Lake,
a large lake formed by a dam across the Rio Grande.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OVERTON – Armyworms are on the march in East Texas.</p>
<p>&quot;This time they're everywhere, in home lawns, pastures and hay meadows.
It looks like this infestation is much larger than those in July and early
August,&quot; said Dennis Smith, agriculture and natural resource agent with
Texas Cooperative Extension in Gregg County. Smith and other Extension agents in
East Texas have been getting more calls than usual this year. The outbreak has
to do with the weather, said Allen Knutson, Extension entomologist.
<p>Outbreaks typically happen in the fall, and for reasons unknown are worse
when rains are frequent and temperatures are cooler, said Knutson, who is based
in Dallas.
<p>Fall armyworm moths migrate in the millions, literally, northward from South
Texas in the spring and summer. As part of its natural life cycle, each moth
will deposit a clump composed of 50 to100 eggs on individual blades of grass.</p>
<p>&quot;During the last week of their development, armyworm larvae eat 80
percent of their total food intake. For this reason, damage can occur very
quickly and hay fields or pastures can seem to disappear almost overnight.&quot;</p>

<br>
New information on a recent bee attack that killed a Big Spring man. Tests to determine whether or not the honey bees were of the "Africanized" variety are now back.<br>
<br>
According to a state lab the bees that attacked and killed 48-year-old Johnny Darden were indeed the Africanized variety, or what are popularly called "killer" bees.<br>
<br>
The information comes from the Texas Honeybee Identification Lab.<br>
<br>
Darden died after being stung approximately 200 times. At the time, he was trying to help remove a bee hive from a residence on the 5600 block of E. Midway Street in Big Spring.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not far west of the University of Texas at Austin campus, a mosaic of neighborhoods stretches south for miles toward Town Lake, which runs through the heart of Austin. Tarrytown, Enfield and other neighborhoods in this area contain closely spaced homes that range from turn-of-the-century stone mansions to simpler, clapboard houses, all surrounded by stately oaks and well-manicured lawns. Less visible to passersby are low mounds of soil here and there on these lawns, evidence of what may be the best remaining stronghold of native fire ants that have been Texas residents for millions of years.</p>
<p>“That area of Austin probably has the biggest patch of native fire ants left in the southern U.S.,” said Professor Larry Gilbert, who has taken on a foreign fire ant that is wiping out the natives’ territory throughout Texas and nearby states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m a native Texan,” he said, “and I feel a great loyalty to the habitat in Texas.”<br>
<br>
So when he saw native fire ant mounds there being rapidly replaced by those of Brazilian imports in 1981, he wanted to do something about it. The lanky ecologist has been digging deeper into fire ant ecology ever since.&nbsp;</p>

Identified in Rodents in West Texas, Panhandle</a></h3>
<p>The Texas Department of Health (TDH) confirmed today that <i>Yersinia pestis</i>,
the bacterium that causes plague, has been detected in wood rats found dead in a
rural location near the Midland-Glasscock counties border in West Texas and in
fleas from wild prairie dogs in Dallam County in the Texas Panhandle.</p>
<p>TDH zoonosis control officials said it is not unusual to have plague in wild
rodents in the western United States, including the western part of Texas.</p>
<p>&quot;Plague occasionally cycles through the wild rodent population,
sometimes causing large die-offs of rats, prairie dogs and other rodents,&quot;
said Tom Sidwa, Austin, acting director of TDH's zoonosis control program.</p>
<p>Plague is usually spread by fleas that have bitten an infected rodent. The
illness can be transmitted to dogs, cats and humans. Plague in humans can be
effectively treated with antibiotics if detected early, Sidwa said. Infection
also can occur by breathing in respiratory droplets from a live animal that has
the pneumonic form of the illness.</p>
<p>The last recorded human case of plague in Texas was in 1993 in a Kent County
resident. An average of 13 human cases a year occur in the United States.</p>

<p>COLLEGE STATION – To most folks, dried insects are something to be swept
out of corners. To John Oswald and Ed Riley, they're a gold mine.
<p>Oswald and Riley oversee the more than 2.5 million preserved insects and
other arthropod species in the Texas A&amp;M University entomology department's
insect collection.
<p>&quot;It is by far the largest (insect collection) in Texas,&quot; said
Oswald, museum curator. &quot;To the best of our knowledge, it is really the
largest entomological research collection between California and Florida and
south of Kansas.&quot;
<p>Most of the specimens – whether dried, in alcohol, or mounted on slides –
come from Texas, the surrounding states and Mexico. However, species have been
collected or donated from many other countries as well.
<p>The collection began about 100 years ago when the department of entomology
was formed, although some of its specimens date back to the late-1800s.
<p>The museum has been expanded by donated specimens, including a butterfly and
moth collection from Roy Kendall of San Antonio. Kendall is a serious amateur
collector who spent about 40 years gathering about 100,000 butterfly and moth
specimens from Texas and other states, Oswald said.
<p>&quot;Kendall's is a very important collection scientifically,&quot; Oswald
said, &quot;not only for the adult butterflies it contains, but also because Roy
was very interested in biology. Instead of just collecting adults, he would also
obtain eggs and larvae,&quot; and raise butterflies from them, resulting in new
information about their biology.
<p>His collection also has more than 20,000 pages of notes on the butterfly and
moth biology, including much information about species' food plant preferences.
<p>Kendall has been sending the collection in one or two lots per year since the
early 1990s, so about three-quarters of it are now at Texas A&amp;M. Before he
releases it to the university, Kendall makes sure all of the information about
each section arrives completed and organized. His collection is well-known among
Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) experts because he published many scientific
papers, said Riley, associate curator of the museum.</p>
<p>The Texas A&amp;M museum sees a constant traffic of loans to researchers,
averaging 60 loans and 15,000 specimens per year, he added.
<p>The museum staff also contracts with Extension to identify insects found in
Texas crops, gardens, yards and landscapes. The staff identifies insects and
supply biological information, formally identifying 200 to 400 species annually
and handling hundreds of additional information requests, he said.
<p>The museum also identifies insects for other state and federal agencies, he
said.
<p>&quot;We identify not only what it is, but we also provide basic information
about its biology and whether it's invasive,&quot; Oswald said.</p>
<p>&quot;The A&amp;M collection is now at a point where it's old enough and
stable enough so that people want to donate their collections to us. They know
it will receive the proper care and be made available to researchers around the
world for study,&quot; Oswald said.</p>

<p>COLLEGE STATION – It's like something out of a science fiction movie.
Squirmy, twisting THINGS dangling by silken threads from trees. You can't visit
your patio anymore. You feel trapped inside the house. They're absolutely
horrid.
<p>Actually, oak leaf rollers are harmless to humans. But the caterpillars can
do significant damage to trees if left unchecked – particularly in some parts
of Central Texas in March and April, said Dr. Bart Drees, entomologist with
Texas Cooperative Extension.
<p>When disturbed oak leaf rollers spin silken threads and dangle from leaves
and branches. Other caterpillars that dangle from silk threads include the
spring and fall cankerworms, which are often called inchworms, he said.
<p>&quot;Heavily infested trees will occasionally be defoliated by mid- to
late-April, when the fully-grown caterpillars form the pupa stage on the tips of
twigs, in bark crevices or on weeds and other plants growing near infested
trees,&quot; he said.
<p>Because of the density and the number of trees, using insecticides to control
the oak leaf roller is not feasible.
<p>&quot;Often the best course of action is to simply do nothing,&quot; he said.
&quot;Post oak trees have survived in South and Central Texas without human
intervention through time, despite periodic pest outbreaks and resulting
defoliation.&quot;
<p>Caterpillar pest outbreaks are cyclic, rarely occurring year after year, he
said.
<p>For people, Drees suggests wearing broad-rimmed hats and long-sleeved shirts
while outdoors if the oak leaf rollers are numerous enough to be bothersome.
<p>&quot;Knowing that these caterpillars are harmless to people and animals and
their occurrence is seasonal may provide some comfort,&quot; he said.<br>

STEPHENVILLE – If imported fire ants dreamed – and who knows if they do or don't – then a tiny protozoa could be their worst nightmare.<br>
<br>
Even better news: Texas A&amp;M University System entomologists have completed a survey that detected the protozoa in fire ant colonies in approximately 120 of the 157 Texas counties where they have been found.<br>
<br>
Once a colony is infected, the protozoa debilitates the queen, the workers and even the larvae. The disease shortens their the ants' life spans and raises the mortality of sexual females.<br>

<p>COLLEGE STATION – Harris County's first positive case of West Nile Virus in
2004 -- in a dead blue jay -- is an early warning, said Dr. Jim Olson, Texas
Agricultural Experiment Station entomologist.</p>
<p>&quot;(West Nile virus) isn't back; it just never left,&quot; Olson said of
the confirmation of the disease this month.
<p>The mild winter in southern Texas has allowed the mosquitoes -- and the
disease -- to survive. Populations of the primary vector, a mosquito called
Culex quinquefasciatus or southern house mosquito, have never died back. The
mosquito &quot;never went to bed,&quot; Olson said.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="-1">Abstract.</font></i> <font size="-1">As the climate
  warms, many species are moving to higher latitudes and elevations. However,
  range shifts can be caused by many factors. These factors are unknown in most
  cases. The specific role of climate in these dynamics needs study to better
  predict future consequences of global warming. This case study evaluates
  whether warming is driving the northward range expansion of a skipper
  butterfly (<a href="http://www.itis.usda.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=all&amp;search_value=Atalopedes+campestris&amp;search_kingdom=every&amp;search_span=exactly_for&amp;categories=All&amp;source=html&amp;search_credRating=All" target="itis_window"><i>Atalopedes
  campestris</i></a>). Recently colonized areas have warmed 2–4°C over the
  past 50 years. To assess the importance of climate change for population
  persistence in these areas, I compared population dynamics at two locations
  (at the current range edge and just inside the range) that differ by 2–3°C.
  Population growth rate at these two locations over two years was positively
  correlated with January mean and annual mean temperatures. To determine
  whether larval overwinter survivorship could explain this correlation, I
  transplanted larvae over winter to both sites. Larval survivorship was very
  low at both locations, but significantly lower at the range edge, probably
  because lower lethal temperatures frequently occurred there. To estimate the
  direct effect of cold stress on larval survivorship, I applied a previously
  derived hazard-rate model based on laboratory experiments. With input from
  field-measured daily mean temperature, the model accurately predicted
  transplant survivorship at both locations over two winters. Combined results
  from population and larval transplant analyses indicate that winter
  temperatures directly affect the persistence of <a href="http://www.itis.usda.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=all&amp;search_value=A.+campestris&amp;search_kingdom=every&amp;search_span=exactly_for&amp;categories=All&amp;source=html&amp;search_credRating=All" target="itis_window"><i>A.

  prerequisite for this butterfly's range expansion.</font></p>

correlations between <i>S. invicta </i>density and species richness of both ants

A total of 37 ant species, representing 16 genera, were found to coexist with <i>S.

as well as the diversities of other ants and arthropods are regulated by common
factors (e.g., productivity). Many invaded communities may be more resistant to <i>S.

<p>A new chemical compound developed cooperatively by scientists with the
Agricultural Research Service and the U.S. Department of Defense looks promising
as the key active ingredient in new, safe insect repellents for U.S. military
personnel and eventually for the general public. ARS has patented the new
compound, called SS220, and it is currently undergoing toxicology tests required
for registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>ARS, USDA's chief in-house scientific research agency, has several
specialized laboratories with expertise in studying biting insects such as
mosquitoes, ticks and flies that can transmit diseases to humans.</p>
<p>DOD launched a Strategic Technology Objective three years ago to identify and
develop a new standard military insect repellent to replace DEET, a repellent
developed 50 years ago by ARS for the military. DEET is the most widely used
repellent in the world and has prevented uncounted cases of malaria and other
vector-borne diseases in both civilians and military. During the research
project, researchers sought a new repellent effective against a wider range of
mosquito species, and compatible with commonly used plastics such as in eyeglass
frames and military equipment.</p>

<p>It's a blood-sucking parasite with the potential to spread a fatal disease to U.S. cattle and cost the beef industry billions of dollars. Thanks to a successful eradication program in the U.S., that hasn't been the case.<br>
<br>
But cattle fever ticks still infest northern Mexico and parts of Texas, and keeping the parasite under control in the southern U.S. is becoming increasingly difficult.<br>
<br>
Over the last 20 years, several factors have been contributing to this complex situation, says John George, laboratory director for the USDA's Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Lab in Kerrville, TX.</p>

<p>WESLACO -- If your trees are being pruned without your knowledge or consent,
fear not. The culprit is not some deranged gardener.
<p>The pruning is most likely the work of an insect commonly known by various
names including twig girdlers, twig pruners or long-horned beetles, for their
extra long antennae.
<p>John Norman, a cotton integrated pest management (IPM) entomologist at the
Texas A&amp;M Agricultural Research and Extension Center at Weslaco, said
several species are common and native to the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and their
populations seem to peak in cycles.</p>

<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today designated nine species of
invertebrates known only from caves in the northern part of Bexar County, Texas,
as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.</p>
<p>In 1992, several local groups (Alamo Group of the Sierra Club, Balcones
Canyonlands Conservation Coalition, Helotes Creek Association, Texas Cave
Management Association, and Texas Speleological Association) petitioned the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service to add the nine species of karst invertebrates to the
List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife. The nine species are the Helotes
mould beetle (<i>Batrisodes venyivi</i>), the Robber Baron Cave harvestman (<i>Texella
cokendolpheri</i>), the Robber Baron Cave spider (<i>Cicurina baronia</i>),
Madla’s cave spider (<i>Cicurina madla</i>), the vesper cave spider (<i>Cincurina
vespera)</i>, the Government Canyon cave spider (<i>Neoleptoneta microps</i>),
as well as another cave spider (<i>Cicurina venii</i>) and two cave beetles (<i>Rhadine
exilis </i>and <i>Rhadine infernalis</i>) that do not have common names.</p>
