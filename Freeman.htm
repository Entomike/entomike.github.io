<p>Hugh Avery Freeman, a noted expert on butterflies and a retired Dallas

science teacher, died Tuesday at his Garland home.

<p>Services for Mr. Freeman, 89, were Friday in Garland.

<p>People from various countries would consult Mr. Freeman about butterflies,

said his daughter, Linda Stafford of Houston.

<p>&quot;He loved nature; it was not only butterflies, he knew a great deal

about botany,&quot; she said.

<p>Mr. Freeman, whose excursions took him through the Southwest and Mexico,

identified more than 100 species of butterflies, his family said. His

collections are on display in museums.

<p>Mr. Freeman, who was born in 1912 in Conway, Ark., earned a bachelor's degree

in biology from Hendrix College in 1935. He earned a master's degree in zoology

from Southern Methodist University in 1938.

<p>Mr. Freeman taught at area high schools. From 1954 until his retirement in

1981, he taught at Hillcrest High School. He was the school's Teacher of the

Year in 1963.

<p>&quot;He really did take something that was dry for a lot of people and made

it interesting because he had a passion for it himself,&quot; Ms. Stafford said.

<p>He taught biology at SMU from 1948 to 1951, his family said.

<p>Mr. Freeman is also survived by his wife, Louise Freeman of Garland; another

daughter, Julia Matthews of Austin; a son, Gilbert Freeman of Garland; 11

grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

<p>Memorials may be made to the Hillcrest High School Scholarship Fund, 9924

Hillcrest Road, Dallas, TX 75230.</p>
