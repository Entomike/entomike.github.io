        <p><br>
        Tulsa, OK [Sept 23] &quot;Oxley Nature Center, Clear, mid 70's, north
        wind: Between 10 a.m. and noon C.D.T. counted 553 individuals. Only a
        small window between trees to observe from so there were many more
        unseen.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Hammond, OK [Sept. 24] &quot;Hammon Elementary's Third Grade class
        caught, tagged and released 100 Monarch butterflies as they were
        roosting in trees this morning.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Enid, OK [Sept. 22] &quot;Monarchs started arriving Sunday the 22nd and
        have increased into the hundreds by this evening, Monday the 23rd.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Enid, OK [Sept. 25] &quot;The monarchs are still here. Still about a
        thousand, no increase from Tuesday.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Oklahoma City, OK: [Sept 27-29] &quot;Friday I checked a roost that was
        close to 250 in Oklahoma City. The roost we tagged at Saturday morning
        was 200 yards south of the Friday roost and contained about 400. Sunday
        we checked the two roosts, they contained between 1500 to 1700
        combined.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Graham, TX: [Oct. 5] &quot;We had a few monarchs Sept. 28 and 29, but
        many more came in Saturday, October 5th to Graham, TX. We're about 80
        miles northeast of Clyde, TX.&nbsp; We had large clusters on our trees
        in the back yard -- probably 200 to 300 butterflies.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Leuders, TX: [Oct. 6] &quot;We own a ranch in Shackelford county on 180
        and highway 6 about 3 miles south of Leuders, TX.&nbsp; We were out
        there on October 6th and spotted quite a few monarch butterflies.&nbsp;
        I would say that the numbers that we were able to see were in the
        hundreds.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Abilene, TX [Oct. 7] &quot;Within the last 3 days we have seen probably
        anywhere from 10 to 15 thousand monarchs within a 5 mile radius and it
        has been spectacular!!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Hunt, TX: &lt;http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/monarch/FallDataTX_Oct2002.html&gt;<br>

        <br>
        Ballinger, TX [Oct 12] &quot;Tens of thousands of monarchs were sighted
        in and around the Ballinger, Texas area Saturday, October 12th.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Brackettville, TX: [Oct 12] &quot;We tagged 558 monarchs over three days
        - mostly on Oct 12.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Camp Wood, TX: [Oct 14] &quot;Today 10/14/02 in Camp Wood between 5 p.m.
        and 6 p.m., hundreds and hundreds of Monarchs descended on the top of
        the Pecan trees&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Eagle Pass, TX: [Oct 16] &quot;We saw no monarchs on our return [from
        Big Bend NP] until we reached Langtry, then we saw 24 in 60 miles to Del
        Rio. From Del Rio to just north of Eagle Pass we was only 12 crossing
        the road. When we pulled under the trees to park at my house the trees
        exploded and close estimates in about 50 yards gave a count of
        1200--1500 in about 10 trees.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Eagle Pass, TX: [Oct 17] &quot;Before dawn count: 1600 in 10 trees&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Eagle Pass, TX: [Oct 18] &quot;1000 individuals scattered/dispersed
        around 12 trees over a 50 yd. stretch here in the yard.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Eagle Pass, TX: [Oct 19] &quot;Just went out to see the REAL MIGRATION!
        A front came through over the last 6 hours and the monarchs are staging
        out of here in remarkable numbers. I moved north away from the clusters
        still in the trees and counted in one minute 15 monarchs coming from
        further north at 60' or better above ground. About a 1000 still in the
        trees, but getting ready to depart.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Fronton, TX [Oct 20] &quot;It was monarchs as far as you could
        see,&quot; said [Sassine]. &quot;The lowest flying Monarchs observed
        were at around 500 feet high and the kettle, or group, consisted of
        monarchs dispersed vertically up to 2,000 feet. I am a private pilot and
        judged the altitude from a small aircraft flying nearby at an altitude
        of about 2,000 feet. The pilot maneuvered his aircraft in order to avoid
        the mass of butterflies. Most of the folks on the field trip I was
        leading had also never seen anything like this before. It was a unique
        treat. I was at the same exact location the<br>
        next day and there wasn't a single monarch in the sky.&quot; [As
        reported to JNorth]<br>
        <br>
        Monterrey, N.L., Mex: [Oct 21] &quot;As we walked up the side of the
        mountain the Monarchs began to pour through. They were coming through at
        a rate of several 100 per minute.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Angangueo, Mex. [Nov 1] &quot;About 10 trees were covered with
        butterflies (10,000 each?)&quot;<br>

        <h3 align="center">2002 Coastal Flyway Reports of significant numbers:</h3>
        <p><br>
        Texarkana, AR [Oct 12] &quot;The monarchs made it to our area on
        Saturday, October 12. We counted almost 300 monarchs in a period from
        11:30 AM to 1:00 PM.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Sam Rayburn Reservoir, TX [Oct. 29] &quot;We returned to [&quot;GPS
        coordinates are 94.06.487 W and 31.06.291 N.&quot;] on 29 Oct after a
        period of heavy rains for several days, the wind was NE for several
        days.&nbsp; On the evening of 29 Oct there were an estimated 280&nbsp;
        monarchs resting in several pine trees and a deciduous tree&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Baytown, TX [Oct. 29] &quot;This morning from 8am-9am, there was a major
        movement of Monarchs moving SE through the Baytown area.&nbsp; This is
        the first time in a week we have had sunshine.&nbsp; I had a ton of
        errands to run, but pulled over and watched for about a mile down
        TX-146, and had a minimum of 25 Monarchs/minute for the hour cross in my
        field of view.&nbsp; This is the first time we have seen more than a
        half dozen/day in our area.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Texas City, TX: [Oct. 28-29] &quot;Yesterday, 10/28/02 was overcast and
        raining all day but I was able to locate about 300 Monarchs on the Texas
        City Dike. &lt;snip&gt; Today the sun came out so I went to check on my
        &quot;find&quot; and was greeted by a sight that stirred my very soul.&nbsp;
        There were Monarchs on every flower, every blade of grass and on all the
        dried stalks of sunflowers.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Lavaca Bay, TX [Oct. 30] &quot;I have to catch my breath ... report on
        JSouth, &quot;peak migration&quot; ... thousands of monarchs were
        crossing Lavaca Bay this afternoon&quot; &quot;I saw more monarchs
        during those two hours yesterday than I have seen in the past seven
        years combined ... it was fantastic!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Matagorda Beach, TX: [Oct. 31] &quot;Lunched at Matagorda Beach and
        observed the Monarch migration in full swing... &lt;snip&gt; Butterflies traveling
        the corridor between the vegetation line and the surf, up to about 75
        feet +-... Estimate multiple thousands...&lt;snip&gt; Headed NE to SW...
        A few settling in the short vegetation for a rest... Fairly strong NE
        wind, overcast... A thrilling sight...watched for a couple of hours and
        the flight continued unabated...&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Corpus Christi, TX: [Nov. 4] &quot;The Duranta trees and hibiscus plants
        in my front yard are full of Monarch butterflies.&nbsp; At least 15 to
        20 each time I look. (seems like a bunch to me anyway) The trees have
        been &quot;full&quot; for almost a week now.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Mission, TX: [Nov 11] &quot;While monarchs were certainly present it
        wasn't until my last evening there (11-11-02) that I saw a large
        migration moving through.&nbsp; I was in Mission and just happened to
        look up around 5:15 p.m. to see large numbers flying from dozens of feet
        to hundreds of feet in the air flying southwest in typical migration
        formation, riding the wind currents, seldom flapping.&nbsp; In the
        fifteen minutes I watched hundreds flew overhead.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Weslaco, TX: [Nov 11] I teach science at Weslaco East High School.&nbsp;
        On the morning of Nov. 11, students and teachers were outside for a
        Veterans' Day ceremony as the monarch migration passed high overhead.<br>
        <br>
        We've had several large queen migrations during the last month - enough
        to litter the highway between Mercedes and Weslaco some days. I mention
        this because on the morning of the 11th, monarchs and queens were
        migrating together.&nbsp; Every now and then, some would drop down near
        the grassy area where we were standing, and my students could see the
        difference between the two.&nbsp; They were not heading southwest,
        either.&nbsp; They were flying just east of south (I've been carrying
        around a compass lately).<br>
        <br>
        I took my classes outside that morning until about 10:30.&nbsp; When I
        checked again at 12:30, I saw only one monarch and none that afternoon.<br>
