ITINERARY<br>

<br>

<b>Day 1</b>: Fly into Mexico City staying at the Hotel de Cortez. Take taxis to

the hotel from the airport. Those coming in as a group will be met at the

airport. Those arriving separately will be given foolproof instructions on how

to reach the Hotel de Cortez. We will assemble at 5:30 PM for an orientation

chat and a get-acquainted supper at the Cafe Tacuba. On the way to the

restaurant we will walk through the Alameda, a place of immense historical

importance to Mexico, and pass by the white-marbled Palace of Fine Arts.<br>

<br>

<b>Day 2</b>:&nbsp; Depart for Toluca where we will have breakfast. After

breakfast, we will travel south to Malinalco where the Aztec maintained a

redoubt. Here carved out of the mountain above the town is the Aztec temple

where new members of the Order of the Jaguar and Eagles were initiated. These

were the Aztec &quot;special forces&quot; charged with guarding the king and his

palace. They also were expected to distinguish themselves in the &quot;flowery

battles&quot; with the chosen enemy. Below in the center of town is a 17th

century Augustine convent that graces the town plaza. Painted on walls beneath

17 coats of&nbsp; plaster are the Paradise Garden murals. These mural, painted

by Indian artisans, represented an attempt by the Spanish crown and mendicant

religious orders to pacify and Christianize the vanquished Indians.<br>

<br>

<b>Day 3</b>:&nbsp; After a delicious lunch, we depart for the colonial town of

Valle de Bravo. The drive will be through forested mountainous country around

the&nbsp; 15,000' Nevado de Toluca. On the way we will pass by Herrada, the

mountain on which one of the butterfly colonies is located. Weather and

butterflies cooperating, we may see them streaming down the mountain side to

find water. For the naturalist in the group, also in the area are the

golden-browed and red warblers,&nbsp; clay-colored robins, slate-throated

redstarts and if we are lucky a gray-barred wren or mountain trogan.&nbsp; A

picnic lunch will be served in one of the high alpine meadows in view of the

Nevado. There should be an opportunity to observe striped sparrows, bluebirds,

kingbirds and Scott's oriole. That afternoon we will drive to our Hotel Los

Across. Many artisan shops grace the cobbled streets of Valle. Shops featuring

pottery, leather goods, weaving and the usual array of Mexican crafts. We will

stroll through the town and dine at the Restaurant Michoacana. For those who

wish, we will walk to the heights above the town for a fantastic night view of

the town and lake.<br>

<br>

<b>Day 4</b>:&nbsp; After breakfast we will drive to the largest butterfly

colony in the Sierra Campanario near the Ejido, Rosario. On the way we will pass

through Mazahua Indian country where many of the women dress much as they did

before the conquest. We will lunch at one of the local &quot;tiendas&quot; that

features quesadillas, tacos made in hand patted blue Indian corn. Gringo food

will be provided for those who do not wish to test the waters. After lunch we

will climb into the forest where the monarch colony is located and view them at

our leisure. Late afternoon we will descend into the old mining town of

Angangueo where we will stay at the Hotel Don Bruno. An evening walk will show

us some of the flavor of the town that hasn't changed much since the revolution.<br>

<br>

<b>Day 5</b>:&nbsp; We will return early to a second, pristine butterfly colony

located in the Sierra Chincua to view monarch behavior at a different time of

the day. Early afternoon we will pick a spot in the forest near the butterfly

colony for a picnic lunch. After our descent into Angangueo, if time permits, we

will visit the Parker Museum. This museum, maintained by the Angangueo mine,

represents the lives of two expatriates who used Angangueo as a base from which

to travel Mexico of the 30s and 40s. Their adventures and the life of the times

are recorded in many photographs they took.<br>

During the journey to our Hotel San Cayetano, we will descend from boreal forest

to tropical dry deciduous forest. You will experience the contrast between the

high altitude boreal forest where the monarchs live and the dry deciduous

tropical forest the upper slopes of the Rio Balsas. The grounds of the San

Cayetano are immaculately kept; many tropical exotics are present. If we are

lucky we will see a white morpho butterfly meandering along the river. Bring

your swimming suits. There will be opportunity to swim in the fish-shaped pool.

After supper we will see a slide show on the monarchs by our guide Bill Calvert.

The migration biology and natural history, research and conservation efforts to

protect the overwintering colonies are among the topics that will be discussed.<br>

<br>

<b>Day 6</b>: After a leisurely morning touring the grounds of the San Cayetano,

we will visit at the pyramid, San Felipe de los Alsati, built by an unknown

group of Indians. Along the way we are almost sure to see a magnificent

vermilion flycatcher and its mate. In the afternoon we will choose between

exploring and enjoying the exquisite grounds of our hotel and visiting a nearby

waterfall.<br>

<br>

<b>Day 7</b>: Return to Mexico City. We will reach our Hotel de Cortez. in late

afternoon, time enough to tour the nearby Franz Meyer Museums for those

interested. Also nearby is the famous &quot;skeleton&quot; mural of Diego Revera

and the Palacio de Bellas Artes, also full of murals. In the evening we will

re-assemble at our hotel, the de Cortes to have a farewell diner and&nbsp; see a

local version of the ballet folklorico.<br>

<br>

<b>Day 8</b>: Fly home. (Those wishing to shop are encouraged to return late or

on the following day so that they can visit the exquisite Saturday Market (Bazar

Sabado) in San Angel. This market is open every Saturday morning from 9:30ish to

around noon.)</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Features and costs of the trip</b><br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost for the tour will be

$950.00 person for eight days and seven nights double occupancy plus airfare

which, of course, varies greatly depending on where you are from and the timing

of your ticket purchase. The fee includes all meals, lodging and ground

transportation except taxis service to the airport from our hotel in Mexico City

(estimated at $8-9each way).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will endeavor to make the

trip of special interest to teachers by visiting local schools to learn about

the Mexican school system and the problems encountered in teaching in rural

Mexico. Many aspects of&nbsp; Monarch research will be discussed and suggestions

will be made as to how simple science experiments can be done in the classroom

using the Monarch butterfly as a teaching tool to enlighten children and help

scientists learn about the migratory phenomenon. A slide show will be presented

featuring all aspects of monarch biology, some aspects of scientific research

and the conservation biology of the species. The interactions of local people

with monarchs and the impact of monarchs on the local economy will be discussed.

The trip will include visits to two pyramids not generally known to the public.

Finally there will be an opportunity to view many bird species that are endemic

to central Mexico.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of our accommodations and

restaurants are four star. Some of the restaurants we will visit are among the

best in Mexico.</p>

<p><b>Biographical sketch of Bill Calvert</b><br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill Calvert received a BA from

the University of Texas in philosophy and then went off to serve in Uncle Sam's

Army. After two year's soldiering, he decided to do something practical. So he

took up the study of butterflies. For his dissertation project he researched&nbsp;

butterfly feet. More specifically, he investigated the mechanism by which female

butterflies located their host plants. It turns out that they use their front

legs to taste a potential host as final verification of its suitability. After

graduating, he studied bark beetles in Mississippi and later, tent caterpillars

in Massachusetts. While at the University of&nbsp; Massachusetts, he met Lincoln

Brower, one of the world experts on the monarch who was then at Amherst College.

They started a collaboration that has produced over thirty scientific papers on

the monarch and which continues today.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most recently he has become the

Texas coordinator of the Monarch Watch, a non-profit enterprise, the purpose of

which is to learn as much about the biology of the monarch butterfly as possible

using volunteers to extend the range of observation throughout the whole of

Texas, and to use the monarch butterfly to teach basic concepts of ecology, and

reproductive and migration biology. Along the way, the Texas Monarch Watch hopes

to instill in those who come in contact with this beautiful creature an

appreciation of science, and especially of nature. In addition to this, each

migratory season he tries hard to observe the migration in Texas and Mexico to

accumulate information about how they get themselves from latitude 45 to

latitude 20 and find those nine small areas in the highlands of Mexico.</p>

<p><b>Information about Monarch butterfly tours</b><br>

&nbsp;<br>

Suggestions for the Monarch tour<br>

&nbsp;<br>

<b>Accommodations</b>: All three hotels in which we will stay are excellent with

clean, comfortable rooms. Two of them are super hotels bearing many stars.&nbsp;

The one 3 star hotel that we will use (Hotel Balneario Aqua Blanca) was chosen

for its incredible setting and immense biological interest! Agua Blanca may be

closed. If so we will stay at the San Cayetano.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Arrival</b>: You must clear customs. This process is usually perfunctory

and takes only a few minutes. You will probably have to push a button on a

miniature stop light. If green you pass right through. If red they will inspect

you. They may x-ray your luggage in addition to the button-pressing procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Taxis from the airport</b>: P take a taxi to the Hotel De Cortez. Taxi

tickets are sold at booths in the airport that are government controlled. They

will charge you a fixed price based on the zone (section) in which the hotel is

located. Buy a taxi ticket in advance from one of these government ticket

agents. The location nearest the International Exit is around to the left as you

pass out of the customs area (sliding doors) and through the metal poles

(barrier keeping back the hordes of waiting people). Signs to the ticket booths

say SERVICIO TAXIS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<br>

<b>Our hotel</b> in Mexico City is the Hotel de Cortez on Calle (street) Hidalgo

across from the Alameda. It is in the historic zone - zone number four. I paid

about $9.00 in February of 2000, but rates may vary. This fee is good for up to

four people. If more than four, you must buy another ticket.&nbsp; There is

usually a person who speaks English near the booth to help you. It is NOT

recommended to hail taxis off the street in Mexico City. If you are intercepted

by people offering taxis service in the airport, politely refuse them and buy a

ticket from the government sponsored taxis service.&nbsp; After buying the

ticket, you must reenter the main hall, turn left and walk through some glass

doors. There will be many taxis with the airport logo and a number of people to

direct you to a waiting taxi.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<b>Climate and clothing</b>: Daytime temperatures in Mexico City should be in

the mid-60's to mid-70's and could be as low as the 40's or 50's at night.&nbsp;

The Monarch colonies are near 10,000 feet elevation, but we will be at that

elevation only during the day. It will be cool in mornings and evenings and

during cloudy weather. Afternoon temperatures during sunny weather may rise into

the 80's. Expect temperatures from 40 - 90F. We will ride in an open truck up to

the colonies which may produce some wind-chill. Please bring warm clothing such

as a warm, medium weight coat or better, a light coat and sweater - garments

that you can peal off or add on as the temperature changes are best.&nbsp; Also

bring one set of light clothing such as shorts and tee shirts and a swim suit.

Almost any footwear suitable for walking will do from tennis shoes to boots. The

trails are rocky, so ankle support is probably a good idea. Although rain is

unlikely - February/March is the middle of the dry season), please bring

sufficient rain gear to be able to continue activities in a light rain. If we

arrive in the colony area after a long dry spell, road dust thrown up by other

vehicles could be a problem.&nbsp; In this event a handkerchief or dust mask is

very useful. Remember the tropical sun (ca. 20N latitude) is intense. Bring a

brimmed hat and sun screen. Mexican hotels are <b> not heated</b>.&nbsp; Some (Don

Bruno) get cold at night. Bring one set of warm bed clothes just in case.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

<b>Currency</b>: The Mexican peso is somewhere around 9.5 to the dollar. The

best rates have been at bank outlets called Casa de Cambios scattered throughout

Mexico City or at the airport, but every now and then hotels try to accumulate

dollars and give better rates. Unfortunately these times are not predictable.

Since we will be spending most of our time outside of Mexico City where changing

money is difficult, we recommend that you take a few minutes at the airport to

change the money that you think you will need in Mexico. Bank teller's

&quot;booths&quot; line the wall opposite your exit point from Customs into the

airport. The exchange rates among these booths usually vary only a few hundreds

of a peso, but why not get the best rate?&nbsp; Since virtually everything is

included in the price of the tour, you will need only money for snacks,

alcoholic beverages and things you may want to buy.&nbsp; In many cases,

especially in the urban centers, credit cards are accepted.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

<b>Documents</b>: US citizens need only proof of citizenship to enter Mexico. A <b>

birth certificate </b> or<b> passport</b> will do. A voters registration card used to work,

but is now questionable. If you don't have a passport, take an official birth

certificate. You will be issued a tourist card upon entry into Mexico. You will

need to present your copy of the tourist card when leaving Mexico. Losing it

will result in lots of grief!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;

<br>

<b>Health precautions</b>: Please remember that the Monarch colonies are at

10,000 feet elevation. The air is thin. Depending on where the colony forms and

the time of the year, the hike to the colony can be strenuous for people not

used to the altitude. (The colonies tend to form high and move down as the

season progresses. We will visit them after they have moved down slope.) We will

visit two colonies - Rosario and Chincua. In the case of Rosario we start low

and walk up. So visiting in late February or March will be an advantage. In the

case of Chincua we start high and walk down.&nbsp; Their having moved downslope

will be a disadvantage, since we will have to walk further down and then back

up. We ask that you exercise good judgment in deciding whether or not to make

the hike to the Chincua colony. If you have any doubts about your health at

these altitudes, we strongly suggest that you consult your physician.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No vaccinations are required to enter Mexico. The Centers for Disease Control

(404-329-3311) recommends an immunization against yellow fever (good for 10

years) and a gamma globulin shot for the prevention of hepatitis. We will not be

in any hot, steamy tropical lowland areas. The lowest altitude that we will be

at is ca. 4000 feet at Agua Blanca. Please contact the CDC for the latest

information on potential health hazards in Mexico, especially if you will be

visiting areas other than the Monarch sanctuaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the tropical latitude, thin atmosphere and lack of

water vapor and dust in the air, solar radiation is very intense. Bring sun

screen and a brimmed hat for mid-day use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid traveler's diarrhea follow these common-sense rules:

Never drink unpurified water or ice, unpasteurized milk or milk products, or eat

uncooked vegetables or unpeeled fruit. Also avoid undercooked fish, shellfish,

beef and pork, as well as old mayonnaise or creamed mixtures.&nbsp; Purified

water (filtered or electropurified) is available at our hotels.&nbsp; Purified

water is now generally available in Mexico. We will have a 5 gallon container on

the bus for your use. If traveler's diarrhea does occur, Bactrim-DS (or Septra-DS)

is almost an overnight cure. Kaopectate or Imodium can help relieve symptoms.

Drinking and eating cautiously is usually sufficient to avoid the problem.<br>

<br>

<b>Luggage and carry-on</b>: Please limit you baggage to one medium or small

suitcase and one carry on. We suggest that you place all essential medications,

critical items and equipment and a change of field clothes in your carry-on

luggage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<br>

<b>Personal items</b>: Be sure to bring a canteen or water bottle for daily use.

You will need a day pack for carrying personal items while visiting the

butterfly colonies. Other suggested items are an alarm clock, small flashlight,

sunglasses, <b>chapstick</b>, binoculars, and ear plugs. (Even rural towns

in Mexico can be noisy).&nbsp; Many people have missed wash cloths. Rural

Mexican hotels do not supply them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<br>

<b>Photography</b>: For best results photographing the Monarchs, a 50mm lens and a long lens

with plenty of flash is recommended. The Mexican guides at the butterfly

colonies are inconsistent about the use of flash at the colonies. Some prohibit

its use. They believe that flash harms the butterflies, but there is no evidence

to support this claim. There should be opportunities for good butterfly cluster

shots without flash. In general there will be some, albeit limited, opportunity

to use flash. Please contact me directly if you wish to take lots of flash

pictures.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

<b>Time</b>: The part of Mexico that we will visit is on Central Standard Time.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

<b>Birding</b>: Some birds you may expect to see: Gray barred wren,

slate-throated&nbsp; redstart, red warbler, tufted flycatcher, gray

silky-flycatcher,&nbsp; black-backed oriole, black-headed grosbeak, western

bluebird, townsend's warbler, acorn woodpecker, curve-billed thrasher, stellar's

jay, scott's oriole, ruby-crowned kinglet, white-eared hummingbird,

amethyst-throated&nbsp; hummingbird and maybe a mountain trogan and a striped
woodcreeper. A checklist will be available.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Biographical sketch:&nbsp; William H. Calvert</b><br>

<br>

Bill Calvert was a post-doc at the University of Massachusetts when he met

Lincoln Brower then at Amherst College.&nbsp; Dr. Brower's long term research on

the monarch butterfly among other things established the fact that edible

butterflies can be protected from bird predation because birds that learn to

avoid toxic butterflies also refuse to eat other butterflies that look like

them.&nbsp; About this time the famous August 1976 National Geographic magazine

about Urquhart's discovery of the Mexican overwintering site came out with cover

of young lady adorned with countless monarch butterflies. Bill had spent lots of

time in Mexico and was fascinated by the prospect of finding the overwintering

site. Urquhart and the National Geographic kept the site a secret which further

peaked the interest of Brower and Calvert; so they teamed up to try to find it.

With only a couple of clues to go on, Bill combed the mountain ranges of central

Mexico, climbing most peaks over 10,000 feet. His arduous search was more than

fruitful. Instead of a single wintering site for the butterflies, he found nine.

Over several years he mapped them, estimated their numbers and kept track of the

different kinds of mortality occurring. These finding were published in

scientific journals. At the same time he came to know and respect the local

people in rural communities and larger towns. Many of these people are now

working to protect the monarch butterflies and their habitats in the mountainous

fir forests of Michoacan.<br>

<br>

Bill leads several tours a year to Mexico to take interested people to the heart

of the Transvolcanic range to glimpse the awesome aggregations - millions upon

millions of orange/black butterflies&nbsp; festooning the fir trees to the

extent that their green color is no longer&nbsp; visible. Typically the

butterflies hang in huge clusters in the dark, cool parts of the forest. On warm

days many waken and take to the air or land on foliage to bask.&nbsp; On partly

cloudy days when the sun is covered by a cloud, hundreds of thousands of these

baskers, sometimes millions of butterflies, take to the air in a butterfly

blizzard. During late winter they patrol the canopies looking for mates. Once

mated, they begin the long trek back to their northern breeding grounds. After

several generations in the north, the descendants of the original migrants make

their way back to the nine areas in the high mountains of central Mexico. This

group is able to find these small remote areas without having ever having been

their before.<br>
