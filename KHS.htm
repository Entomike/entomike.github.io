<p>Excerpts (with links added):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This issue [and website are] dedicated to the memory
of Karl Heinz Stephan, from the small town of <a href="http://local.google.com/local?ie=UTF8&amp;q=Red+Oak,+ok&amp;t=h&amp;om=1&amp;ll=34.95694,-95.07946&amp;spn=0.027013,0.058365&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=addr">Red
Oak</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latimer_County">Latimer County</a>,
Oklahoma, who passed away in June 2005 of an apparent heart attack. Almost
everyone active in Coleoptera taxonomy in North America and many in other parts
of the world knew of Karl as an extraordinary beetle collector, naturalist, and
author of a number of important beetle monographs.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl's career path was in engineering.
His work on beetles was heavily influenced by that background and by his talents
as a resourceful and practical problem solver. He was quite possibly the most
skilled beetle collector of modern times. Though he employed or cleverly
customized a large number of collecting methods, his true talent was knowing
exactly where and how to collect specimens of reputedly rare species. He had an
uncanny ability to capture some of the rarest and most obscure beetle species in
North America by doing nothing more than walking into his front yard and
rustling a patch of moldy hay into a pan or flipping rocks during just the right
conditions. He would explain that the new species of <i>Arianops</i>
(Staphylinidae: Pselaphinae) and <i>Anillinus</i> (Carabidae) from a particular
hillside could only be taken beneath large rocks during or just following a
torrential downpour. To this day he is probably the only parson who has
collected specimens of those species, and how he figured these things out in the
first place is simply remarkable. [When asked how he collected so many of a rare
colydiine zopherid, he said "Well, first you get up in the morning and go
to the woods. Using your beating sheet, gently pick up small, fallen branches
and beat them over the sheet. Keep doing this and by the end of the day you'll
have 2 or 3."] He was also a cunning opportunist. For a number of years prior
to his retirement in 1996, Karl was the "rural water man" for Latimer
County. The white, columnar water towers that dot the landscape of Latimer
County needed to be serviced periodically. Karl understood local&nbsp; weather
dynamics and knew when these towers would be covered condensation due to temperature
fluctuations. As he would explain, when they were wet they functioned like huge
flight intercept traps, with small beetles sticking to their white-colored surfaces
where they could be easily harvested. ... His 30 years in rural Latimer County
were spent collecting, which has made this county one of the most thoroughly
documented pieces of real estate in the U.S. for beetle diversity. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At last
count, he had recorded 3,516 species</span> based on ~52,500 specimens that comprised
one of his last donations to the <a href="http://insects.tamu.edu/feature/museum/">Texas
A&amp;M Insect Collection</a>. [Karl donated a partial <a href="KarlCollection.html">synoptic set of his beetles</a> to the <a href="http://www.snomnh.ou.edu/collections-research/invertebrates.htm">Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History</a> (SNOMNH). Link to <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/899478">info and list</a> of 3,500 beetle species Karl Stephan collected in Latimer County, OK.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While his collection consisted of all of the local
taxa, it included many rare taxa, including species of general that had not been previously collected in the
United States. ... Though primarily a taxonomist, he also became involved with
ecology, conservation, and education, including instruction at the nearby
community college and presentations to various school groups. He became nationally famous for a time when the endangered
American burying beetle, <i>Nicrophorus</i><i> americanus</i> Oliver, was
starting to become the focus of conservation groups, and he had the only recently
collected specimens from west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl was a wonderful mentor to fellow coleopterists,
especially those just beginning their careers, and displayed all the generosity
towards his guests he could muster. Karl's place was a naturalist's Mecca in the
form [of] a 2-story country house outside <a href="http://local.google.com/local?ie=UTF8&amp;q=Red+Oak,+ok&amp;t=h&amp;om=1&amp;ll=34.95694,-95.07946&amp;spn=0.027013,0.058365&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=addr">Red
Oak</a> on a large tract of land covered mainly by oak/hickory forest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl was also a bit of an academic who had an appreciation
for minutia. He would study specimens in every detail with a microscope that
gave most people an immediate headache, and yet discover characters overlooked
in the past. He also collaborated on various projects and while he lived in
Arizona he was asked by John Lawrence to come to Harvard to work on beetles. He declined,
opting for a workingman's' lifestyle and keeping beetles as a hobby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the aforementioned donations to Texas
A&amp;M, many thousands of specimens from Latimer County and almost his entire
pre-Oklahoma collection from Arizona and Canada (45,000 specimens, ~8,600
species) are housed in the <a href="http://www.fsca-dpi.org/overviewtext.htm">Florida
State Collection of Arthropods</a>. The staphylinids and histerids from this
early material are in the <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org/">Field Museum of Natural
History</a>. Karl discovered a great many new species, many of which are named
after him. At last count he had <a href="#patronyms">22 published patronyms</a> in
13 families by 24 authors, mostly based on his material from Arizona and
Oklahoma. Karl authored or co-authored five genus-group names and 57 species
spread among five beetle families. ... Karl's 50-yr. legacy of beetle
collecting, and his friendly and collegial attitude towards colleagues form a
fitting testimonial to the value of avocational entomology to systematic and
biodiversity research.</p>

<p align="center">Amazingly, the 3,516 species of beetles that Karl documented
from one county in Oklahoma&nbsp;<br>
is nearly twice the number of butterflies (1827) documented from all of
Mexico (<a href="http://www.mariposasmexicanas.com/intro.htm">Warren et al. 2006</a>)</p>
<p align="center">Karl's total also exceeds the total number of birds (3,342) recorded from South America (<a href="http://www.museum.lsu.edu/%7ERemsen/SACCBaseline.htm">Remsen et al. 2014</a>)<br></p>
