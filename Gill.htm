FROM AUDUBON'S DR. FRANK GILL ON WEST NILE VIRUS</span></u></b></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Audubon
Chief of Science Calls on States to Employ Integrated Pest Management</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Ivyland, PA, August
28, 2002 -</span></b> <span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Today,
Audubon Senior Vice President of Science Dr. Frank Gill called on health and
pest control authorities in affected states to employ an integrated approach to
the management of mosquitoes carrying the West Nile Virus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&quot;West Nile Virus
is a disease that, unfortunately, has come to stay in the Western
Hemisphere,&quot; he stated.&nbsp; &quot;It affects people, horses, bats and
other small mammals, and our native birds.&nbsp; While more than 99 percent of
West Nile cases turn out to be completely harmless, the risk of West Nile
nationwide has caused communities to take prudent measures against the
mosquitoes that carry the disease.&nbsp; Our experience with West Nile in the
Northeast shows that an integrated approach to pest management is the most
effective and safest method available.&nbsp; Audubon advises states to enact
measures that will quickly effect this change.&nbsp; It will greatly help
people, other mammals, and the birds which are the disease's primary
victims.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Integrated pest
management calls for elimination of mosquito breeding habitat, the use of
environmentally sound tools to combat the insects, and a more targeted approach
to the use of pesticides.&nbsp; &quot;Communities can greatly enhance their
ability to eliminate the threat of disease-carrying mosquitoes by replacing
chemical larvacides with bacteria-based products, which kill mosquitoes, but not
beneficial insects, such as dragonflies; amphibians; and fish that prey upon
mosquitoes,&quot; Gill continued.&nbsp; &quot;By eliminating pools of stagnant
water in parks and at dumps, and by allowing some drainage of dammed areas,
communities also decrease the available breeding ponds for mosquitoes.&nbsp;
Homeowners can help; cleaning out gutters and removing tarps, tires, and other
objects where water can collect also prevents mosquitoes from reproducing.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&quot;To minimize
collateral damage to people and wildlife, National Audubon calls on public
health officials to follow the New York State Health Department's West Nile
Response Plan, which calls for a measured reaction to the presence of the
virus,&quot; Gill said.&nbsp; &quot;Aerial spraying of pesticides has been shown
to be less effective than targeted, localized spraying.&nbsp; If pesticides are
to be employed, a focused, limited, and timely response works best.&nbsp;
Combining this approach with the use of highly effective bacterial larvacides
and community and home cleanup of standing water is the most effective and
efficient use of our states' energies and limited resources.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Gill also notes the
effect of West Nile falls primarily on our nation's birdlife.&nbsp;
&quot;America's birds - especially crows and jays, and increasingly, it seems,
our beloved hawks and owls - are the most common fatal victims of the
disease,&quot; he stated.&nbsp; &quot;This integrated approach to controlling
mosquitoes will not only help people, but will also help our beleaguered birds
to be more resistant to West Nile.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Finally, Dr. Gill
called on immuno-compromised people, especially the elderly, to take reasonable
precautions against mosquito bites.&nbsp; &quot;By using insect repellent,
wearing long pants and socks, and by staying indoors during dusk and nighttime,
older Americans and those with serious illnesses can greatly decrease their
chances of contracting West Nile.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Audubon is dedicated
to protecting birds and other wildlife and the habitat that supports them.&nbsp;
Our growing network of community-based Audubon Centers, grass roots science
programs for bird enthusiasts, and advocacy on behalf of ecosystems sustaining
important bird populations, engage millions of people of all ages and
backgrounds in positive conservation experiences.</span></i></p>
