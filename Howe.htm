      LAST YEAR’S butterfly collecting seem more drab than usual? Did you find
      that most of the specimens of butterflies that you collected were the same
      ones that you had taken many times before? Have you ever found yourself
      yearning for some exotically different butterfly collecting ground? If so,
      I have the perfect answer for you — try collecting butterflies in
      Mexico!</p>
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="2"></font>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will find Mexico,
      with its magnificent scenery, exotic foods, and foreign customs, a tonic
      for your spirits. But Mexico is, of course, a foreign country; and if you
      should be planning to go there I should like to pass along a few tips
      which will make your trip more enjoyable and productive from the butterfly
      collecting point of view.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mexico, while contiguous
      to the United States, has a vastly different climate from ours. And while
      we have four distinct seasons, Mexico has only two—a dry season and a
      wet one; and they are just that. In the dry season it literally does not
      rain a drop for months on end. In contrast, during the wet season it rains
      every day, particularly during the afternoons. Mexico’s dry season
      corresponds to our winter season and this is precisely the time <i>not </i>to
      go to Mexico if you are in hopes of collecting any butterflies. The dry
      season extends from October to April and in this period it does not even
      sprinkle on the parched earth. By March the mountains are powdery dry, the
      trees have dropped most of their leaves and even the cacti look wilted.
      Needless to say there are few flowers in bloom, and fewer butterflies.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the fact that much of
      Mexico lies within the tropics it can get some of our own frigid winter
      blasts, as it did last year, which have a devastating effect on the native
      plants and insects. In January, 1962, Vera Cruz experienced eight straight
      days of subfreezing temperatures which killed the banyan trees right to
      the ground. Such freezes deplete butterfly populations too, but they
      recover faster than do the banyan trees. I saw mile upon mile of dead
      citrus trees, palms, and royal poincianas — so it can and does get
      really cold down there.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the rainy season commences
      in April or early May and extends until September. The very best time to
      go to Mexico for butterflies is during August, September and October.
      Where you go in Mexico will have something to do with the success of your
      trip as well as when. Remember that the farther south you go in Mexico the
      better the butterfly collecting will become. If you visit only that part
      of Mexico which is adjacent to the United States border, you will not only
      see Mexico at its very worst, but will catch virtually nothing so far as
      butterflies go. When I speak of visiting Mexico I don’t mean just to
      cross the border, take a quick look, and scurry home. Yet most tourists do
      exactly that — and go no farther. This is tragic, for they really haven’t
      seen Mexico at all — not the real Mexico, which can be seen only by
      traveling deep within its rug­gedly beautiful interior.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you visit Mexico your
      entry points will likely be either Brownsville or Laredo, Texas, on the
      international border. Be sure to take out an insurance policy at the
      border with a Mexi­can company. Your stateside automobile insurance won’t
      mean a thing in Mexico if you get in any sort of trouble, for our Latin
      friends do not recognize any North American companies, que lastima! So I
      would suggest that you take out a Mexican policy at either Brownsville or
      Laredo — it costs only seven dollars and is worth it. This way you will
      be insured for probably as long a time as you care to stay in Mexico, for
      the policy does not expire for thirty days and you can renew it for a
      longer period at a small extra cost should you wish to stay in Mexico
      longer.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no difficulty
      whatever in crossing the border. All you need is a tourist card which you
      can obtain at the border. You must tell the number of days or weeks that
      you plan on visiting Mexico, as this will be stamped on your card; and you
      must return before this date ex­pires. You will have to show proof of
      American citizenship before you enter Mexico, but a poll tax receipt will
      do as well as anything. You must have your car title to show them, too,
      and make a written promise not to sell the car while in Mexico; but this
      is no problem either. Now while you may enter Mexico without taking your
      small pox shot, you won’t be able to <i>return </i>to the States without
      showing proof that you have been so immunized within the past three years;
      so if you have no shot you can expect to get a free one on re-entering,
      and you’ll get one too — the American guards don’t overlook <i>anyone!</i></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But your entire border
      crossing won’t take a half hour of your time; and while the Mexican
      customs guards will glance over your luggage, they are very lax on what
      you bring in — it’s what you bring back with you that they are most
      apt to be fussy about. And they’re not fussy about the same things as
      the Americans are. For some reason Mexican customs are extremely care­ful
      not to let native art, artifacts, sculpture or paintings out of Mexico. I
      was advised to leave all of my butterfly paintings on the United States
      side of the border until I returned, for it was likely that Mexico would
      seize them on returning past their customs! I didn’t take the chance; I
      left them in Brownsville.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the instant you cross the
      border you will be entering a different world — for despite the
      closeness of Mexico to the United States the Mexican countryside retains
      characteristics that have stubbornly resisted change for a hundred years.
      Yet contrary to what you might have heard, Mexicans are friendly people
      and will quickly help you if you have any sort of difficulty.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest headaches I found
      in Mexico were the gasolines — their motor fuels just aren’t made for
      Detroit cars or vice-versa. Their most expensive gasolines are poorer than
      our cheapest brands. The dirt in their gasolines clogs up the line in the
      engine, and chokes off the fuel to the fuel pump, or “bomba” as they
      call it down there. I found it necessary to keep the line cleaned out
      every 500 miles — luckily there are ample garage mechanics who can do
      this.</p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="English111 Vivace BT" size="7">F</font>OR
      THE GOOD butterfly collecting grounds you will have to go at least 400
      miles south of the border to even begin to reach the more productive
      areas. Their system of mileage was something I was never able to figure
      out and I was at a continual loss to estimate the distance between one
      city and another, as Mexico uses the metric system. If you approach from
      Brownsville, the first important city you will reach will be Ciudad
      Victoria, capital city of the state of Tamaulipas. By continuing on south
      you will cross the Tropic of Cancer at Jaumave, and at every mile you will
      notice more and more butterflies which often take the attention of even
      the disinterested tourist. At Ciudad Mante you will be at the very foot of
      the Sierra Madre Oriental range. Just south of Ciudad Mante the highway
      divides — one route goes to Tampico on the coast; the other veers
      southwest into the mountains towards Mexico City. Be sure to choose the
      latter route for best butterfly collecting. This route takes you to Nuevo
      Morelos and Ciudad Valles, and there is good butterfly collecting all the
      way from here down to Tamasunchale.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="Howe_El_Salto.jpg" border="0" height="457" width="624"></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this area you will be on
      the northern edge of the true tropics and you will be fascinated with the
      abrupt change of the fauna. You will see whole mountainsides covered with
      palms and other exotic trees. While you are in this area be sure to spend
      a day or so at “El Salto”, which means dropoff — and that’s just
      what it is, a fabulously beautiful waterfall that plunges two thous­and
      feet over a cataract that flows into a narrow gorge below. The roar of the
      falls can be heard miles away and the spectacle is one of Mexico’s most
      impressive sights. You can reach the falls by turning west at Nuevo
      Morelos and taking the highway that leads to San Luis Potosi. There is a
      dirt road that turns off the highway that leads directly to the falls.
      This is a good butterfly collecting spot — one of the best in Mexico.
      Some of the butterflies that are taken here are <i>Anaea portia, Anartia
      fatima, Papilio philolaus, P. cresphontes, Anteos clorinde </i>and <i>A.
      maerula. </i>A beautiful blue Morpho butterfly is also taken here during
      proper season.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the mountain roads
      between Nuevo Morelos and San Luis Potosi there are many good butterfly
      collecting spots, and different species of butterflies appear as different
      elevations are reached. You will take many of the common but beautiful
      purple winged butterfly, <i>Myscelia ethusa, </i>as it glides serenely
      across the road from the underbrush. Also you will see the Calico
      Butterfly, <i>Ageronia fornax, </i>dart about trees here and there; but to
      net one is difficult. The beautiful pearly green Malachite Butterfly, <i>Metamorpha
      steneles </i>is another species that is frequently seen in the wooded
      mountain areas.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout this area you
      will see many sulfur butterflies everywhere. Some are the same as ours
      back home such as the Cloudless Yellow, <i>Phoebis eubule, </i>and the
      Sleepy Yellow, <i>Eurema nicippe; </i>but others are quite different, such
      as the Tailed Sulfur, <i>Eurema gundlachianus. </i>Just about every mile
      of the way you will see the lovely Red Barred Sulfur, <i>Phoebis philea, </i>but
      their fleet flight renders them immunity from your net unless you land a
      lucky stroke for one as it momentarily visits a blossom.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t expect to
      make as good travel time on Mexican highways as you are accustomed to
      doing back in the States; not that their highways aren’t good roads —
      they are; but everywhere you go in Mexico there is the problem of goats,
      sheep, and cattle on the highways. Most of Mexico is unfenced and you can
      wreck your car if you hit one of these animals. The horn helps!</p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="English111 Vivace BT" size="7">R</font>
      EMEMBER that Mexican life moves at a relaxed pace; nobody hurries and no
      matter what town you may happen to be in you will discover that every
      night is Saturday night in the town square — the music and dancing
      continue until morning! You may not sleep well the first night but after a
      night or two of it you’ll get used to it. Actually, I envy them and
      think it’s a wonderful way to live. I still don’t see how our Mexican
      friends can dance all night and still go to work the next day, but they
      manage to!</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the ever-increasing
      waves of North American tourists, the average Mexican cannot speak a word
      of English; and while you can get by in Mexico without knowing any Spanish
      you will have vastly more fun if you learn as much of their language as
      you possibly can. You will discover that no single thing you can do will
      win you so quickly and completely the heart of the Mexican than trying to
      talk to him in his own tongue. But I must warn you that whatever Spanish
      you thought you learned in high school, it isn’t quite the same language
      that they speak here the Mexicans have a brand of Spanish of their very
      own that no <i>Madrileño </i>ever heard of! Yet if you will converse
      every day with as many Mexicans as you can for five days straight, you’ll
      surprise yourself to find how easy it is to learn their language; and you’ll
      learn things about Mexican people that you’ll never learn in any other
      way. And as you know the people better, you’ll like them and Mexico much
      more.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today there are American owned motels in every
      fair sized town the length and breadth of Mexico that will cater to every
      whim of the North American tourist. A dollar and a quarter buys you an
      excellent filet mignon with salad, several vegetables, exotic fruits and
      dessert. Don’t pass up their native chocolate ice cream — there is
      nothing quite so delicious! You will be pleased to discover that your
      American dollar stretches far indeed in Mexico — the rate is twelve and
      a half to one — so even on a modest budget you can go anywhere first
      class in Mexico and enjoy yourself immensely. Keep in mind, too, that
      there are no bothersome restricted parks in Mexico; you can collect
      butterflies <i>anywhere! </i>And no matter how many specimens you catch
      you can bring every one of them back to the States with you when you leave
      this fascinating country. But if you stay in Mexico for seven days you
      will find yourself not wanting to leave. The lush scenery, delicious
      foods, and interesting friendly people combine to cast their spell — it
      is easy to succumb to their easy going way of life. But if you must leave
      you will someday yearn for the day when you can return to the land of the
      prickly pear and coconut palms.</p>
