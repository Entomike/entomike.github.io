      <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">Hola Matt:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">In Corpus and in the RGV the Black
      Witch is a pretty common species. I have at least one a week under the
      lights at the lab and at the house. And have people bringing me Black
      Witches in Mayonnaise jars and Ziplocs on a fairly routine basis during
      the summer. In the valley, Black Witches can be found in the thick, shaded
      riparian habitats in the daytime. Good places to find them during the day
      are: the wooded trail from the hobo camp to the old girl scout camp at
      Falcon Dam, the Jaguarundi trail -south and other heavily wooded trails at
      Santa Ana, and the Riparian smugglers trail from Roma to Escobares to name
      a few. They often flush from the trunks of trees and can really scare the
      hell out of you especially when in areas where not many gringos dare to
      venture. &lt;giggle&gt;. So yes, the numerous reports are quite typical
      IMO. I think we just have alot more people looking now and as a result
      more reports. I suspect that many are local residents and some may also be
      migrants. In my experience I have seen more Black Witches during the day
      than I have seen coming to Black lights at night.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">I am a new user, and find
      TX-BUTTERFLY very interesting.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">Someone asked if the Black Witch
      sightings were typical or not, and is there a local breeding population. I
      cannot give a definitive answer to the question, but will simply share my
      experience.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">I have lived in Harris County for
      more than fifty years (I'm not going to say how much more). As a kid, I
      was very interested in butterflies and moths. I spent a lot of time
      outdoors, and I collected them. And then, for many years, butterflies
      &amp; moths took a back seat to lots of other things, but I still spent a
      lot of time outdoors.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">I never saw a Black Witch until
      September 21, 1998, when I saw one in Baytown. Of course I didn't see
      everything, but you would think I would have seen one occasionally if they
      were very common.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">I didn't see my second BW until this
      year. I had some plum trees that dropped some of their fruit, and it was
      on the ground. On 6-8-01, I checked the plums trees to see if I could find
      some plums that were still good. And there, feasting on a rotting plum,
      was a Black Witch. And then I saw another. And another. And another! Four
      of them! I certainly hope that "La Diabla" doesn't bring bad
      luck! (The story about the Mexican cab driver was hilarious.) The next
      day, June 9, my husband saw one in Liberty County. I saw my last one June
      14.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">I wonder if Tropical Storm Allison
      had anything to do with their abundance?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">They are interesting, and they
      certainly can startle a person under the right circumstances. My husband
      went to check the oil in his truck, and as he raised the hood, a Black
      Witch fluttered, bat-like, right up in his face. Nearly made him hurt
      himself!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">Hello all - here are some images to
      share with the list. The first is one of a black witch, photographed last
      month with a digital camera on a front porch here in Stephenville. Since
      everyone is seeing black witches this year, I checked with one of the
      local amateurs and he said the last time he saw one was in 1989. Then he
      pulled out an owl moth (<a href="http://www.daltonstate.edu/galeps/Webpages/Noctuidae/Thzenobia.htm">Thysania
      zenobia</a>) [link added] that he had found here in December the same
      year. I've never seen one of these locally and don't know anything about
      them, but will post the image as soon as we get one. He donated the
      specimen which will be going to the TAMU entomology museum if you are
      interested in it.</font></p>
