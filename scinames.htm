<p>The annotated "Scientific Names List for Butterfly Species of North

America, North of Mexico" by P.A. Opler and A.D. Warren has just been

published (2002) in the Contributions of the Gillette Museum of Arthropod Biodiversity.

The retail price is $18.00 (postage paid).<br>

<br>

This is the first list of scientific names of North American butterfly species

prepared and reviewed by systematists since that of C.D. Ferris (1989).<br>

<br>

This list contains the most current scientific names for 780 North American

butterfly species (Papilionoidea and Hesperiodea).&nbsp; Authorship and date of

publication (many corrected) are included.&nbsp; The original spelling of

species names are given in accord with recent practices.&nbsp; Annotations with

literature citations are given for many of the names as explanation for their

current usage.&nbsp; Species are numbered for curatorial purposes (subspecies

are not listed).&nbsp; Significant input was provided by many lepidopterists,

but especially significant input was provided by Gerardo Lamas (author of

Neotropical Butterfly Checklist [in press]) and Jonathan Pelham (author of

upcoming synonymical catalogue of North American butterflies [in preparation],

which will include subspecies).<br>

<br>

Also included are a list of Hawaiian butterflies and a list of species names

excluded from the North American fauna (with brief explanations).<br>

<br>

The strength of this list is not only its completely up-to-date nomenclature,

but the fact that over 380 references are provided that substantiate the names

provided. (An updated (as of May 2003) PDF version of this list is available <a href="http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/old_site/uasm//Opler&amp;Warren.pdf"><b><font color="#0000ff">HERE</font></b></a>.)<br>

<br>

The list in 83 pages in length, has clear plastic cover, black plastic back

cover, and black coil binding for durability.<br>
