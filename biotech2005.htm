<h1 align="center">Did Biotech Crops Affect the 2004 Monarch Population?</h1>
<hr>
<h2 align="center">2004-05 Monarch Population Estimate and Recent History</h2>
<p align="center">An estimated 2.19 hectares were occupied by Monarchs (Fig. 1)
in the <a href="http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/monarch/SanctuaryDecreeMapNov2000.html">Monarch Sanctuary Butterfly Reserve</a>
during the winter of 2004-2005.<br>
The actual number of Monarchs per hectare is not known, but estimates range from
10 to 50 million. (1 hectare = 2.47 acres)</p>
<p align="center">There has been much discussion of this historically low number
of overwintering Monarch butterflies in Mexico<br>
&nbsp;in both the popular press, such as on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A45376-2005Feb22?language=printer">the
front page of the Washington Post</a> and in the scientific community:</p>

<p align="center">While a mere 2.19 ha of occupied Monarch habitat is extremely
disconcerting, if we use the end of winter<br>
(post-freeze) population estimates, Monarchs only occupied less than 4 ha at the end
of 4 of the last 5 winters.<br>
A severe storm also occurred on 2-3 March 2000 (discussed in Taylor, 2001) killing
an unknown number of Monarchs.<br>
If we include this storm, then the end of winter Monarch population probably
occupied less than 5 ha in 7 out of 8 years. (Fig. 2)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Miraculously, these freezes all occurred during years of
average to above average Monarch populations.<br>
Another point to note is that the Monarch population <u>increased</u> <u>substantially</u>
over six of the last ten summers,<br>
and <u> more</u> <u> than</u> <u>tripled</u> following the previous historically low populations
of 00/01 and 01/02.</b></p>
<p align="center">Heavy rains followed by a freeze are the worst case scenario as
Monarchs have a very low tolerance to freezing temperatures when wet.&nbsp;<br>
Monarchs are usually spared heavy winter rains as <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5rl99">they
form their colonies during Mexico's dry season</a>.</p>

<h2 align="center">Why was the 2004-05 Overwintering Population Low?</h2>
<p align="center">Given that the Monarchs increased substantially from their
previous historical low winter populations of 00/01 and 01/02,<br>
why didn't the monarchs similarly recover from the post-freeze low of the 03/04 winter?</p>
<p align="center">One possible contributing factor to the non-recovery is the ever increasing
percentage of&nbsp; <i><br>
Bt</i> and herbicide tolerant biotech crops, particularly corn and
soybeans.</p>
<h3 align="center">First some background...</h3>
<p align="center">Wassenaar &amp; Hobson (1998) determined through their study
of the isotopes of overwintering Monarchs&nbsp;<br>
and of milkweed plants from across eastern North America, that the Monarch overwintering colonies
in Mexico&nbsp;<br>
were composed of&nbsp; individuals that migrated mainly from the Midwestern United States
(Fig. 3).</p>

<h2 align="center">Monarch Origins Based on Tag Data</h2>
<p>The origins of Monarchs are perhaps best demonstrated from <a href="http://www.naba.org/chapters/nabast/monarchtag.html">tags
placed on their wings</a> that are subsequently recovered at the overwintering
sites in Mexico. <font color="#0000FF"><a href="http://www.monarchwatch.org">Monarch Watch
Organization</a></font>, University of Kansas, runs the <a href="http://www.monarchwatch.org/tagmig/tag1.htm">tagging
program</a> for the eastern United States. In December 1998, Chip Taylor,
Director of Monarch Watch, decided to offer a reward of 50 pesos (~$5 US) for
each tag recovered in Mexico (Taylor, 1999). The number of tags recovered
increased dramatically as word of the reward quickly spread (Table 1). Prior to
offering a reward, Monarch Watch annually recovered 10-15 tags in Mexico
(Taylor, 1999).&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the storms and subsequent freezes of 2-3 March 2000 and 12-13 January
2002, Monarch Watch severely strained to pay for some 698 and 1790 recovered
tags (respectively). (Read about Monarch Watch's <a href="http://www.monarchwatch.org/update/2005/0114.html#2">Tag Recovery Fund</a>,

<p align="center">Both corn and soybeans are rapidly being converted from
traditional plants to plants that are genetically modified.&nbsp;<br>
Corn is being converted to <i>Bt </i>Corn which gives the plants insecticidal
properties that effect caterpillars that feed on it.<br>
Over 80% of the soybeans planted in the U.S. last year were genetically modified
to be herbicide tolerant</p>
<p align="center">The potential dangers of <i>Bt</i> corn made world news on May 20,
1999 when Cornell University researchers published a paper&nbsp;<br>
(Losey, et al. 1999) demonstrating that the pollen from <i>Bt</i> corn could
harm monarch larvae under laboratory conditions.</p>
<p align="center">The extreme amount of attention that this issue received
caused an immediate drop in the acreage of <i>Bt </i>corn (Fig. 5).</p>

<p align="left">This study provides a geographic information system (GIS) based
assessment of the effective breeding habitat for the summer generations. We
estimate that for the 95% breeding area 65.1% or 2.25 million km2 constitute
milkweed/Monarch habitat. If Canada were included in our figures, the total
effective breeding area would be 2.50 million km2 of Monarch butterflies in
eastern North America.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Suitable Monarch habitats were considered to be any open
habitats which appeared to have the potential to sustain milkweed populations.
In fact, much of the &quot;suitable habitat&quot; contains little or no
milkweed. The landcover classification shows that many of the suitable habitats
are intensely managed (e.g., alfalfa) and probably lack milkweed. At this point,
because there are no surveys for milkweed abundance across all of the landcover
types, we can only speculate how much of the &quot;suitable habitat&quot; is
actually populated with milkweed plants. We estimate that 60% of this suitable
or effective breeding habitat contains milkweed. If this is true and we use 2.5
million km2 as the effective breeding habitat for eastern North America, then
1.5 million km2 (370.6 million acres) account for the Monarch productivity each

during the 2004 growing season in the Midwest,</b>  along with improved plant
        genetics and farming practices<b>, produced exceptionally high
yields of all major crops</b> with resulting record yields 10 to 25 percent
above prior records, an exceptional increase. [<a href="http://www.usda.gov/nass/aggraphs/cornyld.htm">example</a>]
Record corn and soybean yields in
Illinois and five other states had profound effects on crop prices, etc. Crop
experts, regional farmers, and crop-weather models failed to detect and predict
the enormous magnitude of the final yields. This inability to assess the
magnitude of the 2004 crop yields likely resulted from a lack of information
about the presence and effect of the frequent days with clear skies in 2004. <b>The
number of clear days, 50 percent to 105 percent above average across the entire
Midwest, also were accompanied by much below average temperatures and normal
rainfall.</b> Examination of Illinois climate conditions over the past 117 years
reveals that when many clear days occurred, most summers were quite hot and dry.
Only one prior summer (1927) had comparable conditions to those in 2004. Summer
2004 weather conditions also were unusual in other respects, including having
characteristics that were beneficial for all crops. For example, prior record
high yields occurred in 2003 for corn, in 1994 for soybeans, in 2001 for
sorghum, and in 1990 for alfalfa. Seldom does the entire Midwest experience near
uniform summer weather conditions, reflecting another climatologically-unique
aspect of summer 2004 weather. <b>Canadian high-pressure centers, resulting from
the intrusion of 20 strong cold fronts, frequently dominated the atmospheric
circulation across the central United States during the summer</b>, limiting the
movement of warm, moist air into the region and creating the season’s high
frequency of clear days.</td>
