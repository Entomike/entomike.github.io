      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been conducting scientific research on
      the American Hesperiidae since 1930. In 1965 I began careful collecting
      and study of the Hesperiidae of Mexico. Previous recorded evidence at that
      time listed 450 known species of Hesperiidae for Mexico. To date I have
      either collected or examined specimens that have increased that number to
      688. The main purpose in conducting this research was to prepare a
      publication that would give complete data on the taxonomy, synonymy, and
      distribution of all the known species of Hesperiidae found to occur in
      Mexico. When this study is completed such a publications will be prepared.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research conducted in Mexico in 1973-74, under
      grants 1211 and 1323, consisted of extensive collection over various areas
      of Mexico, chiefly in the states of San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, and
      Chiapas, together with the examination of specimens from Yucatan, Quintana
      Roo, Tabasco, and Oaxaca received from other collectors. Scientific data
      were obtained on approximately 500 species, resulting in the discovery of
      15 new species and 39 new records for Mexico. In order to make this study
      as complete as possible I made trips to Washington, D. C., to examine all
      the tropical American Hesperiidae in the National Museum of Natural
      History, to New York to spend some time in checking all the Mexican
      Hesperiidae in the American Museum on Natural History, and to other
      museums in the United States. In addition, complete data were obtained on
      all Mexican Hesperiidae from the British Museum. Thus the research covered
      the main collections of American Hesperiidae in the world. At present my
      collection of Mexican Hesperiidae is the most complete in existence.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collecting methods consisted of first locating
      favorable areas in Mexico and then spending considerable time in obtaining
      as many specimens as possible during the summer months. Each specimen
      collected was placed in a triangular envelops with complete data placed on
      it. During the winter months these specimens were relaxed and mounted.
      When dry they were then classified and placed in my collection. When new
      species or records were found, various articles were written for
      publication describing the new species and listing the new records. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of research in 1975, under grant
      1455, nine more new species were discovered and seven more new records of
      hesperiids were found among specimens collected in the states of Veracruz
      and Oaxaca. These are treated in the articles cited in the References
      (Freeman, 1979 a and b).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specimens are still being mounted and placed in
      my collection that were obtained during 1974 and 1975 to give more
      information on the distribution of the various species in Mexico. At
      present time my records show over 700 species to be found in that country.
      In the near future sufficient information will have been obtained to
      prepare the finished publication on all of the Hesperiidae from Mexico.</p>
