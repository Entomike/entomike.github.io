<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">ACTION: Final rule.<br>

----------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>

<br>

SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines three aquatic

invertebrate species known only from Comal and Hays counties, Texas, to be

endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).

The invertebrates to be listed are Peck's cave amphipod (<i>Stygobromus pecki</i>),

Comal Springs riffle beetle (<i>Heterelmis comalensis</i>), and Comal Springs

dryopid beetle (<i>Stygoparnus comalensis</i>). The primary threat to these

species is a decrease in water quantity and quality as a result of water

withdrawal and other human activities throughout the San Antonio segment of the

Edwards Aquifer. This action implements Federal protection provided by the Act

for these three invertebrates. </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">EFFECTIVE DATE: January 20, 1998. </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule

is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the

Ecological Services Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 10711 Burnet

Road, Suite 200, Austin, Texas 78758. </font></p>

<br>

Background <br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Service designates Peck's cave amphipod (<i>Stygobromus

pecki</i>), Comal Springs riffle beetle (<i>Heterelmis comalensis</i>), and

Comal Springs dryopid beetle (<i>Stygoparnus comalensis</i>) as endangered under

the authority of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). These three aquatic

invertebrate species are restricted in distribution to spring sites in Comal and

Hays counties, Texas, and in the case of Peck's cave amphipod and Comal Springs

dryopid beetle, the associated aquifer. Peck's cave amphipod is known from Comal

Springs and Hueco Springs, both in Comal County. The Comal Springs riffle beetle

is known from Comal Springs and San Marcos Springs (Hays County). The Comal

Springs dryopid beetle is known from Comal Springs and Fern Bank Springs (Hays

County). </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The

water flowing out of each of these spring orifices comes from the Edwards

Aquifer (Balcones Fault Zone--San Antonio Region), which extends from Hays

County west to Kinney County. Comal Springs are located in Landa Park, which is

owned and operated by the City of New Braunfels, and on private property

adjacent to Landa Park. Hueco Springs and Fern Bank Springs are located on

private property. The San Marcos Springs are located on the property of

Southwest Texas State University. </font> </p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peck's cave amphipod is

a subterranean, aquatic crustacean in the family Crangonyctidae. The Comal

Springs riffle beetle is an aquatic, surface-dwelling species in the family

Elmidae. The Comal Springs dryopid beetle is the only known subterranean member

of the beetle family Dryopidae. Elmid and dryopid beetles live primarily in

flowing, uncontaminated waters. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">The

first recorded specimen of the amphipod <i>Stygobromus</i> (=<i>Stygonectes</i>)

<i>

pecki</i> (Holsinger 1967) was collected by Peck at Comal Springs in June 1964.

Reddell collected a second specimen at the same place in May 1965. In 1967,

Holsinger named the species <i>Stygonectes pecki</i>, in Peck's honor, selecting

the 1965 specimen as the type specimen. Later he included all the nominal <i>Stygonectes</i>

species in the synonymy of the large genus <i>Stygobromus</i>. The Service has

used "cave amphipod" as a generic common name for members of this genus, and

this name was simply transliterated as "Peck's cave amphipod" without

reference to a particular cave. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">Over

300 specimens of Peck's cave amphipod have been collected since its description.

Most specimens were netted from crevices in rock and gravel near the three

largest orifices of Comal Springs on the west side of Landa Park in Comal

County, Texas (Arsuffi 1993, Barr 1993). Barr collected one specimen from a

fourth Comal spring run on private property adjacent to Landa Park and one

specimen from Hueco Springs, about 7 kilometers (km) (4 miles (mi)) north of

Comal Springs (Barr 1993). Despite extensive collecting efforts, no specimens

have been found in other areas of the Edwards Aquifer. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">Like

all members of the exclusively subterranean genus <i>Stygobromus</i>, this

species is eyeless and unpigmented, indicating that its primary habitat is a

zone of permanent darkness in the underground aquifer feeding the springs. Above

ground, individuals are easy prey for predators, but they usually take shelter

in the rock and gravel crevices and may succeed in reentering the spring

orifice. Barr (1993) got most specimens in drift nets at spring orifices and

found them less often as she moved downstream, supporting the notion that they

may be easy prey and do not likely survive for long outside the aquifer. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">The

Comal Springs riffle beetle is a small, aquatic beetle known from Comal Springs

and San Marcos Springs. It was first collected by Bosse in 1976 and was

described in 1988 by Bosse et al. The closest relative of <i>H. comalensis</i>

appears to be H. glabra, a species that occurs farther to the west in the Big

Bend region (Bosse et al. 1988). </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">Adult

Comal Springs riffle beetles are about 2 millimeters (mm) (1/8 inch (in))

long, with females slightly larger than males. Unlike the other two organisms

listed here, the Comal Springs riffle beetle is not a subterranean species. It

occurs in the gravel substrate and shallow riffles in spring runs. Some riffle

beetle species can fly (Brown 1987), but the hind wings of H. comalensis are

short and almost certainly non-functional, making the species incapable of this

mode of dispersal (Bosse et al. 1988). </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">Larvae

have been collected with adults in the gravel substrate of the spring headwaters

and not on submerged wood as is typical of most <i>Heterelmis</i> species (Brown

and Barr 1988). Usual water depth in occupied habitat is 2 to 10 centimeters

(cm)(1 to 4 in) although the beetle may also occur in slightly deeper areas

within the spring runs. Populations are reported to reach their greatest

densities from February to April (Bosse et al. 1988). The Comal Springs riffle

beetle has been collected from spring runs 1, 2, and 3 at Comal Springs in Landa

Park (springs j, k, and l in Brune 1981) and a single specimen was collected

from San Marcos Springs 32 km (20 mi) to the northeast. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">The

Comal Springs dryopid beetle is a recently discovered species. It was first

collected in 1987 and described as a new genus and species in 1992 by Barr

(California State University) and Spangler (National Museum of Natural History,

Smithsonian Institution). Adult Comal Springs dryopid beetles are about 3.0-3.7

mm (1/8 inch) long. They have vestigial (non-functional) eyes, are weakly

pigmented, translucent, and thin-skinned. This species is the first subterranean

aquatic member of its family to be discovered (Brown and Barr 1988; Barr, in

litt. 1990; Barr and Spangler 1992). </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">Collection

records for the Comal Springs dryopid beetle are primarily from spring run 2 at

Comal Springs, but they have also been collected from runs 3 and 4 at Comal and

from Fern Bank Springs about 32 km (20 mi) to the northeast in Hays County.

Collections have been from April through August. Most of the specimens have been

taken from drift nets or from inside the spring orifices. Although the larvae of

the Comal Springs dryopid beetle have been collected in drift nets positioned

over the spring openings, they are presumed to be associated with air-filled

voids inside the spring orifices since all other known dryopid beetle larvae are

terrestrial. Unlike Peck's cave amphipod, the Comal Springs dryopid beetle does

not swim, and it may have a smaller range within the aquifer. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">The

exact depth and subterranean extent of the ranges of the two subterranean

species (Comal Springs dryopid beetle and Peck's cave amphipod) are not

precisely known because of a lack of methodologies available for studying karst

aquifer systems and the organisms that inhabit such systems. Presumably an

interconnected area, the subterranean portion of this habitat, provides for

feeding, growth, survival, and reproduction of the Comal Springs dryopid beetle

and Peck's cave amphipod. However, no specimens of these species have appeared

in collections from 22 artesian and pumped wells flowing from the Edwards

Aquifer (Barr 1993) suggesting that these species may be confined to small areas

surrounding the spring openings and are not distributed throughout the aquifer.

Barr (1993) also surveyed nine springs in Bexar, Comal, and Hays counties

considered most likely to provide habitat for endemic invertebrates and found

Stygoparnus comalensis only at Comal and Fern Bank springs and <i> Stygobromus pecki</i>

only at Comal and Hueco springs. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">Although

these species are fully aquatic and two of the three require flowing water for

respiration, the absolute low water limits for survival are not known. They

survived the drought of the middle 1950's, which resulted in cessation of flow

at Comal Springs from June 13 through November 3, 1956. Hueco Springs is

documented to have gone dry in the past (Brune 1981, Barr 1993) and, although no

information is available for Fern Bank Springs, given its higher elevation, it

has probably gone dry as well (Glenn Longley, Edwards Aquifer Research and Data

Center, personal communication, 1993). San Marcos Springs has not gone dry in

recorded history. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">These

invertebrates were not extirpated by the only recorded temporary cessation of

spring flow. However, given that they are fully aquatic and that no water was

present in the springs for a period of several months, they were probably

negatively impacted. These species are not likely adapted to surviving long

periods of drying (up to several years in duration) that may occur in the

absence of a water management plan for the Edwards Aquifer that accommodates the

needs of these invertebrates. Stagnation of water may be a limiting condition,

particularly for the Comal Springs dryopid beetle and Peck's cave amphipod. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">Stagnation

of water and/or drying within the spring runs and the photic (lighted) zone of

the spring orifices would probably be limiting for the Comal Springs riffle

beetle because natural water flow is considered important to the respiration and

therefore survival of this invertebrate species. Elmid and dryopid beetles have

a mass of tiny, hydrophobic (unwettable) hairs on their underside where they

maintain a thin bubble of air through which gas exchange occurs (Chapman 1982).

This method of respiration loses its effectiveness as the level of dissolved

oxygen in the water decreases. A number of aquatic insects that use dissolved

oxygen rely on flowing water to obtain oxygen.</font></p>
