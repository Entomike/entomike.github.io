<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">According to Chip Taylor, who heads the Monarch
Watch at the University of Kansas, the size of the monarch population in any
given year is dependent upon the number of eggs laid by females in the northern
breeding range (&gt; 39 degrees N latitude) in the last two weeks of July and
the first week of August and the conditions encountered by those larvae. These
are the monarchs that mature to become the migrants that we see in Texas
beginning in late September.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Mid summer reports to the Monarch Watch listserv
(<a href="http://www.monarchwatch.org/dplex/index.htm">Dplex-L</a>) indicated
that moderately good numbers of monarchs were present in nearly all of the
important areas of the northern breeding range. A drought that had been apparent
in these areas had diminished and mid-summer conditions appeared to be favorable
for the buildup of the monarch population; consequently the prospect for a
sizable fall migration through Texas was good.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b><span style="font-weight: bold">The
Pre-migration Migration 2003</span></b></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Studies in Kansas and Texas including monitoring
transects sponsored by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department revealed that in
addition to the main migration which begins in late September and is often
dramatic and showy, monarchs arrived in Texas as early as the first weeks of
August in much lower numbers. Unlike the main mass of migrants that are in
reproductive diapause, these monarchs are breeding and they lay eggs on any
milkweeds that they can find. Because of the practice of cultivating the showy
red and yellow flowered Mexican milkweed (<i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Asclepias
curassavica</span></i>) in Texas gardens, these fall caterpillars have become
noticeable. Observers in Austin and Tyler indicate that as many as three
generations of monarchs have been raised on Mexican milkweeds during this and
previous falls. Whether this increase is due to reproduction by the few local
monarchs that survived the summer in the south or due to a flow of pre-migration
monarchs from the north is not yet clear. The fate of these monarchs raised
outside the main breeding grounds (&gt; 39 degrees N) is unknown, but they are
presumed to join the main migrants in their trek to Central Mexico.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b><span style="font-weight: bold">The Main
Migration 2003</span></b></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The main mass of migrants began to arrive in
Texas around 28 September. As usual the first to report them where observers in
the Abilene area. Thousands were seen clustering 19 miles north of Abilene and
thousands were seen on the Abilene Christian University campus. A day later
reports of migrants started from throughout the Dallas/ Ft. Worth area and
continued steadily for the next three weeks. Several long-time monarch observers
said this was one of the best migrations through the metroplex in memory.
Thousands were reported flying through Dallas on 2 October. By 21 Oct only 10
per hour were observed. On 1 October an observer driving from San Angelo to
Abilene reported up to 15 per minute along the route. It was the beginning of
October and monarchs were on the move in Texas!&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Another transect from Abilene to Del Rio showed
monarchs to be traveling in that area on 6 October. By 13 October they had
arrived in mass near Del Rio. By 16 October thousands were seen in the Quemado
Valley area near Eagle Pass. And on 11 and 13 October thousands were seen at the
Balcones Canyonlands NWR near Austin. On 14 October, 32 per minute were passing
over I-10 near Langtry.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">An unexpected resurgence in the migration
occurred in November. Monarchs drifted through Austin well into November. On 5
November they passed through northeastern Milan County at a rate of 9 per minute
and nearly two weeks later on 17 November, they flew over a small lake in North
Austin at a rate of nearly one per minute On the coast at the Lavaca Bay
Causeway, 200 were counted as late as 27 November. During past years we have
seen very little movement after October except in coastal areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The migration along the coast is seldom as
dramatic as the migration through the central flyway and monarch migration there
is confused with the presence of breeding monarchs that reside there, perhaps
for the entire year. But on 16 October somewhere near 100 per hour were observed
flying along the well-monitored Lavaca Bay Causeway near Port Lavaca. Another
large passage of monarch occurred on 19 October in this same well-monitored
area. On 18 October a hundred were seen near Port Arthur.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The migration through East Texas (east of the
Balcones Fault) is still a great mystery. Reports from this area are sparse and
never as dramatic as in the central flyway. However, south of Sam Rayburn Lake,
a hundred monarchs were spotted on 12 October. We need your help in determining
what is happening in East Texas.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The observations reported above were only the
highlights of the fall 2003 migration. Many of you called in or e-mailed us to
give us this information and much more that was not mentioned. We are greatly
indebted to you for your participation!</p>
